LSG are back into the top four with this victory and they needed that after going three games without a win. SRH's chances are dented with this defeat and now they will have to depend on other results to go in their favour. That's all from this game. We have another game happening right now. Switch tabs and catch all the action. Goodbye and see you..
Krunal Pandya | LSG captain:
With the way they were going I thought 200, but we pulled it back nicely towards the end especially by Yash and Avesh. At this level anything is possible, we had the belief and with players like Stoinis and Pooran, we had to believe. We knew we had to go and there was nothing special (was said during the timeout), luckily it paid off for us and Abhishek's over changed the momentum. He's (Prerak Mankad) coming in for his first season and to come out and bat like that shows a lot of character, really happy for him to coming out here and score those runs. Even he will believe he belongs here.
Prerak Mankad | Player of the Match:
Most important game for us, my score does not matter to me, whichever team I play I want to contribute. I was trying to hit the spinners and couldn't connect, I knew Mayank would try to get me out and I have played against him in domestic cricket, so took my chance. Thanks to the management for giving me this opportunity. I haven't batted a lot at number 3 but have batted in the top four. I back my ability and strength, it worked out in the end. Whatever happens at the other end should not effect me, and because of Stoinis and Pooran we won this game.
Aiden Markram:
I thought it was a decent score, I thought 180 was par. We batted well, probably lacked one partnership that could have got us to the 200-run mark. The wicket got slower throughout the day, we would have taken this total at the start. Pressure is an interesting thing, and the guys tried their best. When you are put under pressure by high-quality players like Stoinis and Pooran, you are going to be tested. Once the righties came in, I don't think I was the man for the job. It's about the guys using the next three games as opportunities, they must make it count.
Nicholas Pooran -
We spoke about adapting, we knew we could target that one over from spin, it was right up to my match-up and thankfully it came off well (on the 31-run over from Abhishek), I did enjoy my batting. It's important to target that 6th bowler, it's a batter's game, no risk, no reward, you have to work on the match-ups. I've played enough international cricket to know how to deal with situations, I expected the bowlers to bowl yorkers and slower balls and was ready for it. Even in T20I cricket, I'd like to bat longer

19:13 Local Time, 13:43 GMT:
What a chase! Lucknow Super Giants were well behind the asking rate when the timeout was taken at the end of 13 overs. But whatever was said during the break it certainly had an impact because the batters came back with greater intent and that showed. The turning point came in the 16th over from Abhishek Sharma - 6, wide, 6, wicket, 6, 6, 6. Stoinis and Pooran just took him apart and put the Super Giants on course to victory. Prerak Mankad played the anchor's role and held the innings together, he got to his maiden IPL fifty and watched the other two unleash themselves. But the difference maker was Nicky P, the West Indian came out blazing and there was no stopping him, smashed 44 off 13 balls and got the chase done with 4 balls to spare. Hang around for the presentations..
19.2
Fazalhaq Farooqi to Pooran,
FOUR
,
LSG win by 7 wickets
. Pooran jumps in joy and pumps his fist. The dugout is happy and we even saw Gambhir having a smile on his face. Full delivery angled down leg, Pooran helps it along the way and beats short fine comfortably
19.1
Fazalhaq Farooqi to Pooran, 2 runs, brilliant from Phillips. The crowd and fans might have given up but not Phillips. Short of length delivery and Pooran pulls it towards deep mid-wicket, the Kiwi sprints to his right and dives to collect it with both hands, quickly releases the ball and keeps it to a brace
Fazalhaq Farooqi [3.0-0-26-0] is back into the attack
4 off the last over.
Farooqi is going to bowl. Markram and Samad having a word with him. Pooran is on strike and SRH need his wicket off the first 1-3 balls to make a match. Is there going to be another twist?

15.6
Abhishek Sharma to Pooran,
SIX
, wow! Three balls, three sixes and the game has changed in a matter of five minutes.
31 off the over.
Abhishek goes round the wicket and fires it around leg-stump, it does not matter for Pooran in this kind of mood, he just kneels down and slog sweeps it over deep mid-wicket. Not as clean as the first two but enough to get it into the crowd
15.5
Abhishek Sharma to Pooran,
SIX
,
fourth six in the over.
Abhishek tries the flicker but it does not work, Pooran clears his front leg and swings through the line, plenty of height and the required distance as well. 25 off the over..
Klaasen, Abhishek and Markram in a conference. Still two balls left and the over has already gone for 19. Time for damage control.

105 meters.
He gets under the quicker full delivery and smokes it over wide long-on

15.3
Abhishek Sharma to Stoinis,
out
Caught by Abdul Samad!! Abhishek has won the battle. Stoinis shakes his head as he walks back. Clever bowling from the spinner. Changed the angle and floated it up outside off, Stoinis had to reach for the big shot and though he middled, there was no height and Samad takes a sharp catch near long-off. That came off the middle but no elevation to clear Samad.

maiden IPL fifty for Mankad.
No big celebration, just a raise of the hand, he knows that the job is not done. Still a long way to go and as a set batter he needs to bat deep. He reaches the milestone with a punch to long-on

Timeout!
The asking rate is in excess of 13 and LSG are yet to hit the accelerator pedal. The previous over they were helped by some sloppy bowling from Farooqi but will need more such overs to keep up with the rate. With Pooran, Badoni and Krunal yet to come, they should look to take on the bowling
Over Summary (7-13 ov)
* de Kock breaks the shackles with a six and a four off the 7th over
* A massive top-edge off a reverse sweep and de Kock gets caught at backward point for 29
* Stoinis gets going with a boundary
* Natarajan bowls a tight 10th over to keep the pressure on LSG
* Mankad breaks the shackles with a boundary off Fazalhaq in the 13th over which ends up as a 14-run over
Parth Majithia
: I feel LSG missed the trick here by not sending Ayush Badoni at 3.

Timeout!
This is a really good start for SRH. The pacers were right on the money and didn't give any freebies which in turn increased the pressure and the spinners have cashed in. LSG need someone to take the game by the scruff of the neck because as the innings progresses it will only get tougher to bat.

Sticks to the wrong 'un and gets it to turn away from the left hander, de Kock goes for the reverse sweep and gets a top-edge, the ball skies towards backward point and Abhishek moves to his left, almost makes a mess but thankfully for SRH he hangs on at the first attempt.

Welcome back.. SRH's momentum was broken in the midst of that crowd trouble with
nuts and bolts being thrown at the LSG dug-out
. Wonder how did they even make its way inside the ground, but back to cricket now and LSG will be chasing 183 for two crucial points. Markram leads the SRH huddle and we're ready to go.. Bhuvneshwar to start, SRH have brought in their impact sub -

LSG bowling today
Krunal and Yash Thakur: 8-0-52-3 | ER: 6.5
Others: 12-0-128-3 | ER: 10.66
Klaasen:
The wicket changed quickly in the middle. There was some spin and decent amount of bounce, there were a few rippers (by Krunal - Markram and Phillips' wicket.) That broke the moment, it was difficult to play the harder length balls. Need to bowl length and slower ones into the wicket, can't be too full. It's not a bad wicket, but it's a bit slow. Can use the natural variations. I reckon if the spinners can bowl quickly into the wicket, the natural variations can take over.
Disappointed of the crowd to be honest, that's not what you want. That also broke the momentum, not great umpiring either.

17:17 Local Time, 11:47 GMT, 17:17 IST:
A par total at this venue? The ball did turn for Krunal Pandya, but there was nothing much in it for the pacers. A lot of starts for SRH, but only three batters went past the 35-run mark. Abhishek Sharma went cheaply, but Anmolpreet made the most of the batting PP along with Tripathi. Both fell by the 9th over mark, Markram and Phillips were dismissed by the 13th over and at 115 for 5, things exactly didn't look rosy for the hosts. It was once again Klaasen who held things for the hosts and he added 58 for the 6th wicket with Abdul Samad, giving his team something to defend. But will 182 be enough? Back for the chase shortly..

Avesh Khan to Klaasen,
out
Caught by Prerak Mankad at long-on!! Klaasen looked irritated and he has holed out to long-on now. Prerak takes the catch, turns back at the crowd and then joins the rest of the mates. Was a low full-toss and was there to be smashed, but Klaasen went hard on the swipe, mistimed it badly and found the fielder in the deep.

THATS OUT!!
Caught!!
18.5
Avesh Khan to Klaasen, no run, Avesh goes full and well outside off as Klaasen pre-empted backing away, he can't reach out and its another dot ball
Something is happening here - Klaasen is chauntering at the LSG dug-out, he ain't happy with the last ball call, some argy-bargy as the crowd get involved, needing the on-field umpire to run all the way to the dug-out and try to calm down things. Andy Flower was having a chat with the umpire as well. It's starting to get ugly even as de Kock and Klaasen, the two South Africans have a chat. Both onfield umpires are near the boundary rope now, did someone throw something at the LSG dug-out? Not sure what exactly happened. Okay, whatever happened has been resolved and we're back to the cricket

no-ball call
, the 3rd umpire reckons that the batter was slightly crouched and he calls it as a fair delivery. That's a shocker though, Samad ain't impressed and has a chat with the square leg umpire, who looked bemused himself

Avesh Khan to Abdul Samad,

Mishra to Anmolpreet Singh,
out
Caught&Bowled!! Loopy delivery by Mishra, Anmolpreet Singh shimmies down the wicket and chips it right back to the bowler. Got a leading edge I think, and the leg-spinner takes a sharp return catch. Bangs the ball on the floor, letting out all that frustration of conceding a six earlier in the over. Just look at that aggression!

Looks to fend this away, but ends up getting a glove to it. The ball flicks the helmet on its way to the keeper, but UltraEdge spots the feather on the glove.

Krunal Pandya:
We would have batted first as well, but I don't mind (bowling) either. It has been an up and down season for us. You have to play good cricket, that's what matters. The wicket looks good and it will play the same. We have a couple of changes.
Prerak
and
Yudhvir
are in for
Hooda
and
Mohsin.
Aiden Markram:
We are going to bat first, looks a good wicket. It will be on the dry side. Hopefully we get a good score and put that scoreboard pressure on them. You have to balance the conditions and what's working for the team. In day games you can't see it (pitch) changing too much. We are in an exciting position, hope it brings out the best in us. We have a batting all-rounder
(Sanvir Singh)
- he comes in for us.
Sunrisers Hyderabad have won the toss and have opted to bat
Right then, it's toss time..
Quinton de Kock:
It's hard, I didn't play for quite a while. Scoring some runs was nice, still disappointed with the outcome of the game. No matter how many runs you score. It's about keeping things simple and handling the pressure as much as we can. That's pretty much it, just focussing on our strengths and we need to play smart cricket. I don't warm-up much, the sun heats us up anyway. Just need to keep the body moving. I don't really mind what we do (bat first or bowl first), but if you look at conditions, you bat or bowl first accordingly.
Abdul Samad:
We started well in the chase of 215 which is always difficult to chase. That gave us the confidence that we could win the game. We have a game changer in Heinrich Klaasen in the middle-order and he set things up. Then Glenn Phillips played a game changing knock. I went there with confidence, got some luck with that no-ball and the last ball was right in the slot to hit for a six. I would have regretted it if I had been dismissed off the first ball (dropped by McCoy) because we had fought hard to get into a winning position. I've practiced to be a finisher, you know you wouldn't get too many balls to face.
Pitch and ground dimensions:
63 metres and 64 metres are the square boundaries respectively, while the straighter boundary is 73 metres. The wicket looks pretty dry, it's flat and hard and there won't be much movement. Looks like a pitch where around 170-180 runs can easily be scored, reckons Hayden.
Quinton de Kock who missed out most part of the tournament played a fine knock against the Gujarat Titans in his first game of the season. However, Kyle Mayers also played an impressive innings as the two LSG openers got them off to a fantastic start. The batters who followed next were not able to maintain the momentum though as the Giants innings derailed against Gujarat during the run chase. Deepak Hooda's arrival broke the flow of LSG's innings as they were thumped by the defending champions quite comfortably in the end. On the other hand, the Sunrisers have also struggled to find consistency this time around. They pulled off a heist against the Royals chasing a massive total of 214. But will they be able to do it over and over again? Only time will tell. The toss and teams are not far away, stay tuned..
IPL 2023 qualification scenarios: MI continue ascent towards playoffs
Despite the defeat, Gujarat Titans are still on course for a top-two finish
Gujarat Titans, Chennai Super Kings and Mumbai Indians are sitting pretty in the top three, like always. So it's only the fourth spot that the remaining teams are fighting for. RR, LSG, RCB, PBKS and SRH are the teams fighting for a spot in the playoffs, but SRH's loss today probably throws them out of the tournament. But given they are playing at home, they are the favourites to win this game. Also, Lucknow have been a lacklustre over the last few matches with a couple of losses and a game that ended in no result. Their last win came in the last week of April, so it would be interesting to see if the Giants manage to get back to winning ways today.
14:10 IST:
Had it been the IPL of few years ago, by this stage we would have been in the playoffs. However, with the number of teams extended to 10, we still have quite some action left this season. The withdrawal symptoms have slowly started to creep in though as we move towards the business end of the tournament. Hello and welcome to the 58th contest of the season as two teams struggling for consistency face-off in today's afternoon clash. It's the Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Lucknow Super Giants. Like I said before, had it been an IPL with 8 teams, this game would have probably been the Eliminator. Coincidentally, if the Sunrisers lose today, they are likely to get eliminated from the race to playoffs.

Preview:
In what has to be the most competitive IPL season ever, we've gone past 80 percent of the league stages with all ten teams still in the playoffs race. Apart from Gujarat Titans, the rest of the teams find themselves in a hustle for the playoff spots. Two such sides, at extreme ends in terms of form and momentum, are set to face-off with the loser likely to be on the brink of elimination.
Lucknow Super Giants started the season on a high with four wins from their first six games but have lost steam since then. They're currenly on a four-match winless streak that includes three losses and a no result. Losing regular captain KL Rahul to injury has not helped and they are a side that look vulnerable at the moment, despite all the ammunition that they still have in their squad.
Sunrisers Hyderabad are relatively in a better space mentally. They endured five losses from their first seven games but have won two of their last three games, including an astounding heist against Rajasthan Royals. Tactically and in terms of their playing XIs, SRH have often lost the plot but as things stand, their fate is still in their own hands.
LSG have most bases covered and look a well-rounded side although it remains to be seen how much Rahul's absence dents them as the batting unit now lacks that solidity that he brings at the top. There is immense firepower though and this coupled with a solid bowling unit makes Lucknow a very tricky opposition to face.
SRH are overseas-heavy when it comes to their batting department but the likes of Rahul Tripathi and Abhishek Sharma have shown their presence as well. Surprisingly, the bowling hasn't hit its strap as consistently as they would have liked and against an imposing LSG batting line-up, the hosts have their task cut out. Two desperate sides gunning for survival - it doesn't get better than this.
When:
Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Lucknow Supergiants, IPL 2023, May 13, 15:30 IST
Where:
Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium, Hyderabad
What to expect:
It's been a hot few days in Hyderabad and that's likely to continue across the weekend with Saturday afternoon expected to be no different. Surfaces here have been had mixed results this season. While the average score batting first is approximately 171, two of the five games saw scores under 150. This will be only the second day game of the season and the previous match, which was also the opening game here, saw Rajasthan make 203. Another decent batting surface should be in the offing, although it could be a tad slower with all the cricket played and the heat factor.
Head-to-head:
Teams
Sunrisers Hyderabad
Injury/Unavailable:
There is a lack of clarity around Mayank Agarwal, who was absent last game and didn't find himself in the subs list either. Unless it was a forced move due to injury, Anmolpreet Singh should keep his spot.
Tactics & Match-ups:
Bhuvneshwar Kumar could hold the aces at the start for SRH as he has always had the explosive Quinton de Kock on a tight leash in the IPL. The South African hasn't lost his wicket to Bhuvneshwar but has managed to score 49 runs off 52 balls he's faced from him.
Probable XI:
Abhishek Sharma, Anmolpreet Singh/Mayank Agarwal, Aiden Markram(c), Heinrich Klaasen(wk), Glenn Phillips, Abdul Samad, Vivrant Sharma, Marco Jansen, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mayank Markhande, T Natarajan
Potential Impact sub:
T Natarajan/Rahul Tripathi
Lucknow Super Giants
Injury/Unavailability:
None reported
Tactics & Match-ups:
Early bowling duty for Krunal Pandya could be on the cards. He has bowled 30 balls to Rahul Tripathi in the IPL, dismissing him twice and giving away just 28 runs. He has also dismissed Aiden Markram twice in seven deliveries.
Probable XI:
Quinton de Kock(wk), Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis, Ayush Badoni, Deepak Hooda, Nicholas Pooran, Krunal Pandya(c), Ravi Bishnoi, Avesh Khan, Mohsin Khan, Yash Thakur
Potential Impact Sub:
Ayush Badoni/Amit Mishra
What they said:
"We gave too many runs in the first innings. When it's 227, you have to go hard every over. The surface played really well. The batters said it was a good wicket to bat on. Had we restricted them to 200-210, we would have had a chance." -
Krunal Pandya
, after their loss to Gujarat Titans four days ago.
"This [finish against RR] will give a lot of belief in guys like Samad. Samad would've felt that he missed out on a couple of times. To have done it here, the next time he comes to bat and the next time he's in a situation like this, he'll be a lot different." - SRH's batting coach
Hemang Badani
