Lucknow really doesn't care for the six-hitting trends of the season. Try hitting sixes here on this pitch. Anyway, the results over the last couple of days means that this tournament is still wide open. Punjab beating CSK, MI beating RR, now RCB beating LSG. The top four haven't been allowed to run away from the rest of the table. So that's all we have from here. Thanks for joining in. This is Sagar Chawla signing off on behalf of Harish and Raju Peethala. Goodbye!
Faf, Player of the Match:
Opposite, complete opposites (the pitch here vs Chinnaswamy). We played really well in the first six overs. That's when you can play the same way. To have a fifty partnership in the six overs was match changing. Batting first was important. Spinners was hard work. Even Mahipal got the ball to hold. If you can bowl the ball on a good area, it's pretty hard to score. Would've liked 135 - in my mind that was a really good score. Before we went on the field, we said to the guys it's a match-winning score. Felt if we get 2-3 in the powerplay, especially with KL not being there, it's going to be difficult. Super happy for Karn. Just one of those guys who does the hard work all the time but doesn't get the recognition. Great to have Hazlewood back. Nothing to the guys who've filled his shoes. But good to have him.
Krunal Pandya | LSG stand-in captain:
We did pretty well, restricting them to 126 was a great bowling effort. Really happy with how we have bowled in this tournament. We would have taken 126 but batting-wise we did not execute our plans. It is such a sad thing he pulled his hip-flexor. I don't know how bad it is, the medical team will assess it.
Josh Hazlewood:
It's been a long layoff, a bit nervous getting out there. Great to be out there in front of some good fans. The wicket looked quite tough, would have liked a few more runs. It was super loud (the venue) for both teams and it (intensity) gets the crowd up and the team up as well.

23:38 Local Time, 18:08 GMT, 23:38 IST:
RCB only had 126 to defend, and they've made it seem like plenty. A win for them by 18 runs. These two teams produced a 425-run thriller earlier in the season, but today it was a complete struggle for the batters on a very difficult pitch. Very slow, very sluggish with the ball not coming on at all, while also gripping and turning. LSG knew they had to make the most of the powerplay, and after the first two overs which yielded just 2 runs, they didn't stop swinging. But that approach just didn't work on this pitch. Whenever a batter tried to take the aggressive route, in either innings, a wicket was round the corner. Maybe it needed a Rahul to see LSG over the line. But unfortunately he was injured and only walked out when the game was gone.
19.5
Harshal Patel to Mishra,
out
Caught by Karthik!! How did that go behind the wicket to the keeper? Anyway RCB have wrapped this up! Slower ball floated up at the stumps, Mishra looks for a lofted drive down the ground, mistimes it so horribly that it goes behind him, giving Karthik a simple catch.

KL Rahul, right handed bat, comes to the crease
Wow Rahul has walked out to bat despite an injured leg. Don't think he'll be able to run, and he can't have a runner either
18.4
Hazlewood to Naveen-ul-Haq,
out
Caught by Karthik!! That shoud be it! Oh wait, Rahul is coming out to bat! Not over yet! This is short outside off, Naveen-ul-Haq tries a ramp but nicks it to the keeper

16.6
Siraj to Naveen-ul-Haq,
no ball
, given as no-ball by the square leg umpire for being the second bouncer of the over. Faf has reviewed. Banged in short, Naveen-ul-Haq ducks but it would've surely been over his shoulder in his upright stance. The decision is upheld. Free hit coming up

out
Ravi Bishnoi Run Out!! 1 run completed. Another run out. Bishnoi gone trying to take a second, and LSG are eight down! It was reverse-swept to backward point, the fielder puts down a difficult chance over his head and it trickles away behind him. Bishnoi thinks two is on, but Harshal, who was at short third, retrieves the ball and fires it to Karthik who breaks the stumps. Bishnoi well short despite a dive.

Timeout! Looks difficult for LSG to come back into the game from here. They've lost the cream of the batting, and Mishra and Bishnoi are struggling to even get singles. Required rate is close to 9 which is huge on this pitch

Harshal Patel to Gowtham,
out
Gowtham Run Out!! 1 run completed. A run-out appeal has been referred to the third umpire. Oh he's gone! Gowtham was batting so well, but he's been run out! What a breakthrough! Could well be the game! Good length outside off, Gowtham pushes it through backward point and runs hard. It's tight on the second run with the fielder charging across, but Gowtham risks it. And he pays. That was brilliant from Sonu Yadav who attacked the ball and released a flat throw on the bounce to DK.

Karn Sharma to Pooran,
out
Caught by Lomror!! This was coming. Right from ball one you could sense that Pooran was here to try and counter attack and had absolutely no intentions of hanging around. He picked the right ball but just didn't get the desired timing. Picked the legbreak from outside leg and got too much height than distance on the slogsweep. Lomror at deep square runs across to his right and puts in a dive to complete the catch. Half the side back in the hut for the home side.

Hasaranga to Hooda,
out
Stumped!! Hooda could believe what he just saw on the big screen. To be fair, he had an air of guilt surrounding him soon as the umpire took it upstairs. He perhaps knew? It was the the gentle legbreak from Hasaranga, managed to beat the prodding blade of Hooda. Beat the outside edge and got the ball to skid at a nice height to DK. Hooda was prodding a little too much and couldn't get his back foot inside in the nick of time. It was just on the line when the bails came off.

Hasaranga to Hooda,
THATS OUT!!
Stumped!!
Umpire's review for stumping:
No issues with the front foot. Hasaranga is the bowler. No spike on the UltraEdge. Gone! Deepak Hooda is gone. He hasn't dragged his foot back enough. LSG in tatters...
Wanindu Hasaranga, right-arm leg break, comes into the attack

Hazlewood to Ayush Badoni,
out
Caught by Kohli!! It's Kohli again. He blows a kiss to someone after taking that catch. Hazlewood got Badoni dancing to his tunes in the first over and perhaps got into his head. He switched ends and bowled this a touch fuller than the good length. Badoni's eyes lit up and he didn't bother to press forward, just a slap drive and it has been intercepted by a leaping VK at cover. Came off the toe end and Kohli leapt to his fullest before grabbing it over his head.

Just relied on timing and didn't bother to exert any power on that. Chips it off the bottom half of the bat and Kohli completes a fine catch running back and to his right at long-off.

Siraj to Mayers,
out
Caught by Anuj Rawat!!
Out for a third-ball duck in Bengaluru and now out for a second-ball duck. Both times it is Mohammed Siraj.
Mayers looks to bash this over the infield but lack of bounce on this skiddy length delivery meant he skewed it off the thick inside half and towards the bottom half of the bat. Anuj backpedals and claims the catch over his head with an air of calmness.

Mayers and Ayush Badoni are at the crease. Mayers is on strike. Siraj will open the attack
Siraj to kickstart proceedings with the ball. This is the
first time Badoni will be opening in the IPL.
KL Rahul is on the sidelines and he is seen limping with a bat towards the dugout. One slip in place, off we go...
Welcome back! Would this be enough? Did RCB miss a trick by not pushing the ball into the gaps and giving themselves an opportunity to steal a few twos maybe? Remember one of the square boundaries today is 72 metres and surely a few more twos/threes would have made that scorecard look slightly better.
It's not KL Rahul. The impact sub Ayush Badoni is straight in and will partner Mayers at the top
Faf:
It's  a slow wicket, not a lot of bounce and thought 135 would be a par score, if we can get 1-2 wickets in the powerplay, will be a tough chase. If you bowl into the wicket, it is stopping and the boundary scoring is also really hard. When we try to force the boundaries it is hitting the toe end of the bat. We got some really good spinners in our side and if we can get those early wickets, it'd be nice.

21:41 Local Time, 16:11 GMT, 21:41 IST:
That last-ball boundary notwithstanding, LSG have bossed that innings. Kohli and Faf put on 62 for the first wicket but there was no intent at all. When Kohli attempted to up the ante, he fell and the likes of Rawat, Maxwell and Prabhudessai just did not get to grips with the pitch. Faf at the other end showed zero intent too as he was content to nudge, nurdle, poke and prod around. KL got injured early on while fielding and Krunal did well to marshall his resources as he was helped by RCB's tactics. Rain came and stopped proceedings for 25 minutes, once it restarted Faf got out and the end overs acceleration never came. For LSG, they just bowled to the conditions and the pitch, using a lot of slower balls and also the boundary dimensions to choke the life out of the innings. Naveen-ul-Haq was the pick of the bowlers with a three-fer. Despite the pitch not an easy one, it will take some effort to contain LSG to under 126. Interesting to see what the status about KL is as well. Back for the chase in 5 minutes...

Karthik Run Out!! What was I mentioning about DK and his backing up just now. It has proved to be his downfall. He has taken a huge start and Hasaranga mistimes it back to Yash Thakur who fields, turns around and hits direct. Thakur is jumping for joy. That is a big wicket for DK looked to be in good nick out there. He attempted to dive back in but no chance.

Sharp back of a length delivery that cuts in off the seam, Lomror on the back foot is playing all around it, misses and it is crashing into all three. Did not get the back pad outside the line of off to escape. The

does not help.

Shocking lack of intent from RCB. And when they tried to show some, they have lost wickets. Totally un-Faf-like innings this. He is nudging and nurdling out there. Yes the pitch is tacky and helping spinners but RCB playing right into LSG's hands with their bizarre tactics.

Maxwell reviews but it's just clipping and that will do for Ravi Bishnoi and LSG.

Gowtham to Anuj Rawat,
out
Caught by Mayers!! Picks out deep mid-wicket. Slower and outside off, Anuj Rawat goes on the back foot to pull and does not get enough on it, finds the man stationed there. Krunal is happy as he celebrates with Gowtham. Rawat is not happy as he swings his bat at thin air in frustration.

Ganesh Katigar
: RCB should try Manoj Bhandage at some point of time as he can be a good all rounder, since he has good strike rate in batting and a decent season in the recent Karnataka Premier League with the ball as well  (State level T20 tournament).

Good powerplay for RCB as the
timeout
is taken. LSG will be worried more about KL and whether he can bat, remember no runners allowed and that makes it so difficult to bat with an apparent hamstring injury. Will KL be Impact-subbed out? For now we wait on an update.

Naveen-ul-Haq to Kohli,
FOUR
, beautiful adjustment. Was a slower ball on a length outside off, Kohli steps out and then adjusts to guide it between backward point and short third man
AK
: RCB should have opened with Anuj Rawat. Left right combo would have kept LSG thinking. Suprisingly he is the only leftie. RCb should consider throwing in Hasaranga as the dasher.

Naveen-ul-Haq, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attack
du Plessis is not happy with something. He backs out as Naveen runs in.

The owner of LSG is a worried man. A substitute comes on for KL. Who will lead LSG now? Will it be Pooran or Krunal or Stoinis?

He is down and holding his right leg. Bad news for LSG. Was a length delivery outside off, du Plessis drives wide of cover and KL gave it a good chase before pulling up before the boundary cushions. He is grimacing as a couple of team-mates come towards him to check
Early doors still but 150 should be a good score on this pitch. Not your typical 200 wicket.

Kohli and du Plessis are at the crease. Kohli is on strike. Krunal Pandya will open the attack
Krunal from round the wicket with long-off back.
LSG in good spirits in their huddle as RCB's openers walk out to the middle. Good atmosphere at Ekana tonight. Let's hope we have a cracker of a game. And no surprises - Krunal to start off. KL going with the matchups. A slip in for Krunal. The countdown is done and we are ready.
Here's a pre-match interview.
Harshal Patel:
Got ten wickets, but to be honest I'm not bowling the way I want to be bowling. There are few areas I still want to get better at and have more impact later on in the tournament. I do my review after every game and I realized that I have been bowling a couple of deliveries which are freebies in T20s, I want to cut down on those and create more wicket-taking opportunities. The conditions are suited for my kind of bowling here and having said that, they have great batters and the idea is to be consistent in our plans and execution. Virat has always been the leader whether he is captaining or not, his energy is contagious on and off the field and every time you have a chat with him, you come out a lot more inspired and motivated. We all value that a lot and the love for him is exceptional in any part of the world and always great to have someone like him in the team.
LSG Impact subs:
Badoni, Daniel Sams, Avesh Khan, De Kock and Prerak Mankad.
RCB Impact subs:
Harshal Patel, Shahbaz, Vyshak, Bracewell and Sonu Yadav.

KL Rahul:
It is just going to be hardwork on this pitch for both teams. Just one change.
Avesh Khan misses out and K Gowtham comes in
. Having played here twice, we know that spin will be used more than pace here. Just want to hold our composure during crunch moments. The only thing we spoke about is to not come with a fixed mindset and we gotta bowl well and restrict them to a low total.
Faf:
We are gonna have a bat. There will be little more turn in the second innings I feel. I feel much better now. We got
Hazlewood in tonight, and Anuj comes in for Shahbaz
. Our squad is  well-suited for these conditions. It is just about batting well tonight.
Royal Challengers Bangalore have won the toss and have opted to bat
Toss time:
Faf is back. He calls heads and it comes down as heads...
Pitch report:
The square boundaries - one side is 72 metres, the other side is 63 metres. Straight it is 78 metres. It is a black soil pitch, so the bounce is relatively low. May not be high-scoring, but expect a bigger score than 145 - with inputs from
Sanjay Manjrekar
and
Rohan Gavaskar
.
L W W L W:
Just like their opponents, RCB lost two and won three from their last five. They just played two away games so far and have a fifty percent win ratio while at it. After this game, they will have a five day break before taking on DC (away) and MI (away) in the space of 4 days.
W L W L W:
That's the recent-record of LSG. Their next two games are against CSK (home) and GT (away), on Wednesday and Sunday respectively. Can they do the double against RCB tonight? In 4 games at home so far, they won two and lost two.
MI's win last night ensured there's enough spice for the mid-season table muddle. Barring GT and LSG, the other 8 teams have lost at least 4 or more thus far. Whether LSG taste their 4th defeat or replace GT at the top of the table is a question that will be answered by the end of this game. As for RCB, a win will help them drift into the top half of the table. Plenty of pre-match pudding coming your way, stick around...
RCB rope in Kedar Jadhav as David Willey's replacement
The middle order batter has previously played 17 games for RCB, across 2016 and 2017 seasons
18:16 local, 12:46 GMT:
If the previous game between these two sides is anything to go by, buckle up folks, we are in for a helluva contest. Fifties from RCB's top-three. LSG lose their top three inside 4 overs. Stoinis counter-attack, Nic Pooran's breathtaking 19-balll 62 and Badoni's hit-wicket harakiri. As if that wasn't enough, there was that last ball drama. Run-out attempt, Bishnoi running helter-skelter, DK's moment of panic and Avesh Khan's penalty-worthy-helmet-slamming celebration as LSG became only the second team in the history of IPL to win off the last ball with one wicket standing. Runs or wickets, doesn't matter which column stands bright tonight. There's plenty of scores to be settled between these two. Hello and a warm welcome to the 43rd league game. It's the Lucknow Super Giants taking on the Royal Challengers Bangalore. Which team are you backing tonight?

Prakash Govindasreenivasan
It can perhaps be said most years, but in this season particularly, inconsistent run of results will not yield progress. Every time Virat Kohli and Faf du Plessis's RCB appear to take a big leap towards the top-four, they've immediately been dragged back a notch. They have won as many as they've lost - both home and away - and are on the outside looking in at an intense top-four race for now.
With the impending Karnataka elections, RCB are in a unique position in their quest for an upward surge in the points table. They have a long six-game stint on the road that begins on Monday at the Ekana stadium in Lucknow - the antithesis to the Chinnaswamy, as far as conditions go.
But that shouldn't entirely put them off as their bowlers have struggled on the true pitches at home this season. The likes of Harshal Patel and Wanindu Hasaranga will welcome the chance to bowl at a venue with the lowest average first innings score this season (152). RCB's fate though, could rest on how well their batting heavylifters Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell fare at a ground where the ball will not come onto the bat easily. The question is can the troika that has an average strike rate of 162.34 this season, bat with more caution considering batters around them have struggled.
LSG meanwhile, will have mixed feelings about returning to Lucknow. Their batting unit, that produced a jaw-dropping 257 on a true belter in Mohali, have found life tough on sluggish home pitches. Though the batting has suffered, their bowlers have been the silver lining, as they've maximised the conditions. They've picked 30 wickets in 4 fixtures and have the best average (18.50), strike rate (15.90) and economy rate (6.98) for a home side this season.
The previous meeting between these two teams this season turned out to be a thrill-a-minute, final ball finish at a throbbing Chinnaswamy stadium. Runs might not be as freely on offer at LSG's home, but given the opposing strengths of the two teams, expect another close contest, even if a low-scoring one.
When:
Lucknow Super Giants vs Royal Challengers Bangalore, May 1, 2023, 07:30 PM IST
Where:
Bharat Ratna Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Cricket Stadium, Lucknow
What to expect:
Batting struggles. The average first innings score of 152 is the lowest across venues this season. Thunderstorms are expected an hour ahead of the game but the anticipation is for it to not have an impact on the game.
Head to head:
RCB have a 2-1 advantage over LSG. In all three fixtures, RCB batted first.
Team news
Lucknow Super Giants
Injury/Unavailability:
Marcus Stoinis's availability will depend on the fitness test on Sunday (April 30). The Aussie all-rounder had hurt his finger in the previous game after being hit by an Atharva Taide drive on his follow-through. Stoinis had to leave the field at that point but Badoni reckoned on the eve of the fixture that it was a minor injury.
Tactics & match-ups:
Avesh Khan has done well previously against both RCB openers Virat Kohli and Faf du Plessis. To Kohli, he's bowled 22 balls, conceded just 23 and dismissed him twice. To Du Plessis, he has conceded 48 off 41 and dismissed him once.
The spicier contests though, will be between Amit Mishra and two RCB stalwarts - Kohli and Glenn Maxwell. It's been fiery both ways as Kohli has smashed at 156.12 and Maxwell at 186.05, but Mishra has dismissed the former thrice and the latter five times. The slow surface at the venue might yet side with the veteran leggie.
Probable XI:
KL Rahul (c), Kyle Mayers, Marcus Stoinis/Quinton de Kock, Ayush Badoni, Nicholas Pooran (wk), Deepak Hooda, Krunal Pandya, Naveen Ul-Haq, Ravi Bishnoi, Avesh Khan, Yash Thakur/Yudhvir Singh Charak
Royal Challengers Bangalore
Injury/Unavailability:
The fitness status of Josh Hazlewood remains unknown. He'd trained during RCB's day fixture on April 23 but was not bowling in the nets on Sunday in Lucknow.
Tactics & match-ups:
Harshal Patel could be RCB's man to stop Marcus Stoinis in his tracks. The Aussie, fresh from a 40-ball 72, averages 169.12 against RCB but has found it tough to put away Harshal in his previous face-offs against the pacer. Harshal has conceded just 26 off 19 balls against Stoinis and has dismissed him twice in the same period.
If Harshal's hand injury hasn't fully healed yet, he will not be risked during the batting innings and could be used as an impact player.
Probable XI:
Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis, Shahbaz Ahmed, Glenn Maxwell, Mahipal Lomror, Dinesh Karthik, Suyash Prabhudessai/Karn Sharma, David Willey, Wanindu Hasaranga, Vijaykumar Vyshak, Mohammed Siraj
What They Said:
"It's fun batting with Kyle Mayers. He doesn't let the pressure come to me because of how quickly he scores his runs. Mayers is batting really well so I think we'll go with Mayers now. But hopefully, Quinton can play soon too. You'll get a surprise." -
