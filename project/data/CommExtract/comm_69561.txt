Another eliminator and another loss for LSG. Interestingly, both losses have come while chasing in excess of 180-plus scores. Wasn't too long ago, Hardik said that he would hope to see his brother in Ahmedabad but instead it will be his former team he will be facing up against in the second qualifier. It's now down to three teams. Who will meet CSK on Sunday? We'll have to wait till Friday to trace the answer. Do remember to join us for that high-voltage clash. Remember, MI are the only team (from the playoff set) to beat Gujarat Titans in the league stage. Until Ahmedabad on Friday, this is
Raju Peethala
signiing off alongside
Nikhil Jadhav, Akshay Maanay
and
Siva.
Cheers!!
Akash Madhwal | Player of the Match:
I have been practicing a lot and waiting for my opportunity. I have done engineering, cricket is my passion and I have been waiting for this since 2018. When we practice in the nets, the management gives us the target and we try to execute our best. Hoping to do well in the coming games and want to end up as champions. The wicket of Nicholas Pooran was most pleasing for me.
Rohit Sharma | MI Skipper:
That is what we have done over the years. People don't expect us to do what we have done, but we managed to. He (Akash) was the part of the team last year as a support bowler, and once Jofra was gone and I knew he had skills and the character to do the job for us. Over the years we have seen many guys coming in from Mumbai Indians and playing for India. It is important to make them (youngsters) feel special and make them feel part of the team, my job is to just make them comfortable in the middle. They are very clear in their roles about what they need to do for the team and that's what you want. As a team we enjoyed it (fielding). Good to see everyone contributing on the field. Coming to Chennai, we knew whole team needs to come to the party. At Wankhede you need one or two brilliant performances, but here it is a different ball game.
Cameron Green:
Pretty good. It is the most complete game we have had. We are peaking at the right time. It is all clicking at the moment. Madhwal is bowling well, 5-fer today and a 4-fer in the last game. We had a pretty poor game (in the field) last time and we sat down and spoke about hunting in a pack. Obviously while bowling second all the guys are out there and we needed to bring that energy in the field. He (Madhwal) has been awesome ever since he has come into the team. They (Gujarat Titans) are the best team in the competition, slipped up a bit last night, but are still the best team and it will be a good game.
Krunal Pandya | LSG Skipper:
We were in a good position at one stage, but everything started (going wrong) when I played that shot, we should have played better cricket. That shot (his wicket) was not on, I completely take the blame for that. The ball was coming nicely on to the bat, we just had to bat better. We didn't play good cricket after that strategic break. Quinton de Kock is a quality batter, but Mayers has a better record here, so we went ahead (in the playing XI) with him. Their batters bat really well against fast bowlers, so I thought of starting with spin against them.

23:20 local, 17:50 GMT - It's Gujarat Titans vs Mumbai Indians for the second qualifier:
Chasing 182, just one batter crossed 20 for the Lucknow Super Giants. A five-for. Three run-outs. Losing last 8 wickets for 32 runs. In the last 4 games (including this one) LSG had 4 different opening combinations. And here comes the best part: The openers from their last game weren't even part of the impact subs today. And the one who opened the batting last time LSG beat MI (just over a week ago) batted at 7 today. Gee, if those aforementioned facts/stats don't make up for a perfect disaster recipe, not sure what else would. To be fair, LSG conceded at least 20-30 extra and despite Stoinis' brilliance, a first-baller for Nic Pooran and the triple run-out harakiri just ended the disaster that was waiting to explode. As for Mumbai Indians, they will be chuffed to bits and will head into the qualifer with supreme confidence. Post-match reactions coming right up, stay tuned...

Akash Madhwal to Naveen-ul-Haq,
out
Hooda Run Out!! These things are bound to happen when there are constant changes in the team. Hooda has been involved in two run-outs and now he's at the receiving end of another run-out. Naveen-ul-Haq chopped it to the left of Green at backward point and thought about a quick single. Quick glance at his partner and Hooda was already shaking hands by the time Naveen thought of turning back. Green with a full length dive to his right stopped the ball and flung the ball to Rohit Sharma (bowling end) who belted the stumps in absolute delight.

seam-up length delivery outside off, Ravi Bishnoi tried to slog it out of the ground but doesn't get anywhere near the middle of the bat and picks out the safest fielder on the ground at long-on.

Gowtham Run Out!! Look away if you are an LSG fan. What was Gowtham trying to do there? Forced this off the back foot towards backward point where Green made a diving stop to his right. Rohit, at cover, collected the parry and smashed the stumps with a direct hit at the batting end. It bounced off the practice pitch and caught Gowtham  miles short despite the dive. Hooda was never interested in the single and even yelled at his partner as if to suggest what are you trying to do mate? All in all, it's a disaster for LSG. Two run-outs in the span of five balls.

Stoinis Run Out!! 1 run completed. Oh dear! It's getting bad to worse for LSG. It was only earlier in the over there was a slight mix-up between the two and to make matters worse,
both batters ran into each other and in the end Stoinis pays the heavy price for it.
He flicked it to deep mid-wicket and there seemed to be two there but both batters were busy ball-watching after completing the single and ended up colliding mid-pitch. Though it was just a glancing blow for a fleeting moment, that extra second helped David to focus and hurl the ball to the batter's end where Ishan completed the formalities with ease. Stoinis wasn't even in the frame.

From round the wicket, full outside off and holds its line, Pooran pushes and the thick outside-edge is easily held by Ishan. Test-match stuff and MI turning the screws now. Madhwal on a hat-trick too.

A skiddy back of a length delivery on off, a wild hoick across the line more in hope than any conviction, the off-stump takes a walk and LSG are now losing their way. The pressure got to Badoni there and he just wilted.

LSG staying in the game with sensible batting from Krunal Pandya and Stoinis. The latter is the key wicket and then there's Pooran to come too. Game nicely poised at the moment.

The left hand was going to the cushions with the ball in hand, then pushes the ball back and saves a couple of runs. Or is the foot touching when the ball is in hand? Tough call for the third ump and he has given it four. This is a marginal call and Green is not happy. Has his arms stretched wide and shakes his head. Can't blame the third ump though - he had no conclusive angle to work with

1.5
Akash Madhwal to Prerak Mankad,
out
Caught by Hrithik Shokeen!! Straight to deep point and despite Shokeen misjudging it he bends down to take it. Was dipping on him and he did not come fully forward to take it. Full and just outside off, Prerak Mankad makes room to slash and the thick outside-edge flies nicely to the deep fielder. Akash Madhwal provides the early breakthrough.

1.3
Akash Madhwal to Prerak Mankad, no run, superb from Shokeen at backward point and a
direct-hit would have got Mayers.
A back of a length delivery outside off, cut wide of Shokeen who flings to his right and comes up with the ball in his right hand, Mayers was halfway down but Shokeen throws immediately and misses, a fumble from David at mid-on helped Mayers too as he got back in with a full-stretch to beat the throw from David under-arm. A big moment in the game?
What a fine piece of fielding and Mayers is in trouble? Third ump called for a run-out check. Mayers has got back.

Naveen ul Haq:
I think it's a good enough total, we were expecting it to grip and spin, but it was coming on to the bat nicely. You can play on the up (on this pitch), it's a better wicket than the CSK - GT game. I think they (Green and Surya) had a good partnership, and we needed a breakthrough at that point. They (LSG) were expecting those two wickets from me, and I delivered at the right time.

21:27 Local Time, 15:57 GMT, 21:27 IST:
Yesterday CSK posted 172 and won by 15 runs. Tonight MI have got 182. So a very good score on a similar looking pitch. After the openers went early, it was SKY and Green who scored at 10rpo consistently to put the pressure on LSG. Just when MI were looking to take the game away, Naveen came back and took both batters out in the same over. When David fell, MI were forced to bring in an Impact sub - Nehal Wadhera to help extend their batting. That move paid off as Wadhera scored a crucial 23. LSG apart from the last over which went for 14 did well with Naveen and Yash Thakur taking 7 wickets between themselves. If the pitch slows down, it will be advantage MI. And how about dew? Remember MI are playing with just 5 bowlers, so Green is seen warming up to bowl. Back for the chase in 5 minutes...

19.3
Yash Thakur to Nehal Wadhera,

Naveen-ul-Haq to Nehal Wadhera, 1 run, had the throw been to the bowler's end then Nehal Wadhera was gone. But he gets away as it is thrown to Pooran. A full delivery outside off, sliced in the air and Bishnoi on the run did not see Wadhera running halfway for the 2nd. The throw from Pooran hits Naveen-ul-Haq on the left shin I think and now he is down

Naveen-ul-Haq to Jordan, 1 run, short of length and angling into the pads, tucked through deep backward square leg
Chris Jordan, right handed bat, comes to the crease

17.3
Naveen-ul-Haq to Tilak Varma,
wide
, good review from MI. It was Nehal Wadhera who forced Tilak Varma to go for it. Varma did not move and this is just wide of the tramline on the off-side
MI review for a wide. This is not given by umpire Virender Sharma. Is it inside the tramline? It looks just wide of it and Tilak Varma has not moved too. It's a wide
17.3
Naveen-ul-Haq to Tilak Varma,
wide
, this time it is well wide of the tramline outside off
The plan to both left-handers is to bowl well wide outside off
17.2
Naveen-ul-Haq to Nehal Wadhera, 1 run, full and wide outside off, Nehal Wadhera shuffles across and sweeps to deep mid-wicket
Mithlesh
: Considering their fragile batting order, anything above 170 will be challenging for LSG!
17.1
Naveen-ul-Haq to Nehal Wadhera,
SIX
, lots of height and just six over Gowtham's outstretched right hand over his head at deep mid-wicket. Was the full slower ball across him, Nehal Wadhera swings and Gowtham did his best, but the ball had just enough on it

Yash Thakur to Nehal Wadhera, no run, good pacy short ball at Nehal Wadhera who hooks and misses, was over the head but the third ump feels that Wadhera has his back knee crouched and feels it is a fair delivery.
MI lose a review
Now Nehal Wadhera is reviewing for a short ball for height. The square leg umpire Virender Sharma signalled it as one for the over.
Wadhera though reviews.
Again the third ump feels Wadhera has crouched
16.4
Yash Thakur to Nehal Wadhera, no run, full and sliding down leg, Nehal Wadhera flicks and misses, off the pad and Pooran dives to his right to stop the ball
Nehal Wadhera, left handed bat, comes to the crease
MI have brought in their impact sub - SKY off and Wadhera in.
So no extra spinner when they are bowling 2nd.
16.3
Yash Thakur to Tim David,
out
Caught by Hooda!! Just below the waist and the dangerous Tim David is gone. David is unhappy and has  a word with umpire Bruce Oxenford before he walks off. Was a cross-seamer full-toss and David is a tall man, looked a marginal call and the miscuce is caught at long-on. The third ump had a look and gave it in favor of the bowler as he felt David was crouching.
Tim David c Hooda b Yash Thakur 13(13) [4s-1]

Naveen-ul-Haq to Green,
out
Bowled!! Another massive wicket and Naveen-ul-Haq plugs his fingers into both ears in celebration. The slower ball again. It's the off-cutter on a fuller length outside off, cuts back in and beats Green's loose drive. There was a big gap between bat and pad and the off and middle stumps are disturbed. In the matter of an over, LSG have turned this around.

Let's see if the LSG bowlers manage to bowl a few quiet overs and restrict this duo..

Krunal Pandya:
It has been an up and down season, but we have fought and never gave up. We have match winners, it's a team effort from us, that's a really good sign. We have covered all bases, just need to execute our skills. We would have batted first as well, but now we have to play some good cricket.
Rohit Sharma:
We are going to bat first. Typical Chennai wicket, looks good at the moment, don't know how much wear and tear will happen. Back in Mumbai we want to chase, this ground here with a longer boundary, it's better to put up a score. The boys are upbeat about it, we have qualified and we are here. There have been ups and downs, but we have learnt a lot, and learnt what we can do as a team. We are ready for this game. We have one change,
Kartikeya
is out,
Shokeen
is in.
Mumbai Indians have won the toss and have opted to bat
Toss time..
Pitch and ground dimensions:
It's a different pitch than yesterday, the boundaries are contrasting. The off-side boundary is 61 metres, while the leg-side boundary is 70 metres and 77 metres down the ground. The surface used for this game is similar to the one used in the last night's match. The wicket looks abrasive, a lots in it for the spinners. There will be a bit of swing with the new ball, but apart from that, it's going to be spin to win. Batting first is a good option on this wicket, reckons
Matthew Hayden.
"Hello from Chepauk. Tonight's pitch is the one where the CSK-MI game happened where CSK chased just 139. That was the afternoon game though. It's also tough to draw parallels after how last night's game went. That was played on a pitch where the previous game was a 200-v-200 clash," quips our correspondent
Prakash Govindasreenivasan.
The only one bowling on the MI side of practice is Duan Jansen, he adds.
On the other hand, Mumbai Indians have a pretty mediocre bowling attack, however, owing to their batting prowess, they have managed to chase down 200-plus targets with nonchalance. And it wouldn't be a surprise if they continue winning and advance to the final to meet the yellow army. Suryakumar Yadav got off to a shaky start this season, however, the middle order batter has looked in sublime touch since his return to form. Cameron Green, Ishan Kishan and Tim David have chipped in with pivotal contributions, while Nehal Wadhera and Tilak Varma have been the young finishers for MI. When it comes to their bowling, Piyush Chawla has been the leading wicket taker, and apart from the veteran, Behrendorff and Akash Madhwal have been the major contributors with the ball. LSG have a 3-0 head-to-head record against Mumbai Indians, but so did the Gujarat Titans against Chennai before the qualifier. So, don't let the past deceive the present. Stay around for the toss and teams..
Despite losing their captain - KL Rahul to an injury at the halfway stage of the season, Lucknow Super Giants have done exceptionally well to reach this stage. Under the leadership of Krunal Pandya, Lucknow have come up with some inspiring performances over the last couple of weeks, hence they have earned that playoff spot. Due to his late arrival and Kyle Mayers' rollicking form, de Kock missed out most part of the season, but the South African opener has chipped in with useful contributions in the limited number of opportunities presented since then. Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran have played some match defining knocks for the Super Giants throughout the tournament, and that has also been one of the reasons for LSG's success.
18:20 Local Time:
Just less than a week to go, YES - only three more matches left! How quickly time flies! Just like the weekend gets over in the blink of an eye, so does the IPL. More than 70 IPL matches have been played over the last eight weeks, but even that's not enough for few of us, or rather most of us. We want more and more and more! That's the beauty of this tournament, isn't it? Anyway, we are into that territory of the competition from where on, every game is going to be a knockout encounter. Chennai stormed into the final last night, but Gujarat Titans lived to fight another day as they had finished as the table-toppers in the league stage. But from here on - there are no second chances. Welcome to our live coverage of the
Eliminator
folks! It's the
Lucknow Super Giants
who will take on the five-time IPL champions -
Mumbai Indians
at the same venue - MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai where Qualifier 1 was played less than 24 hours back. The winner advances, while the loser goes home, simple equation.
Preview:
After chasing down another 200-plus total on Sunday (May 21) with relative ease, Mumbai Indians had to anxiously wait for the result of the last league encounter. Royal Challengers Bangalore, who had to win to eliminate MI, were taking on a side that had already confirmed their spot in the first qualifier. So MI had all the reasons to feel concerned. However, by the end of the night, their spot in the playoffs was confirmed.
Skipper Rohit Sharma did mention after the SRH game that they only have themselves to blame in case they fail to go through. He was indeed right. Even though MI won three of their last four games to eventually finish with 16 points, their erratic early form forced them to rely on someone else to seal their qualification. Now that's behind them and there is no room for such favours at this stage of the competition. A loss on Wednesday will ensure they don't get a shot at the title for the sixth time.
Lucknow Super Giants were here just 12 months ago in their inaugural season. Last time, it was RCB who eliminated them and they would definitely want to progress further in 2023. The fact that they managed to pull through despite fierce competition from other teams is commendable given they lost their skipper KL Rahul at a crucial stage. While many expected their campaign to fizzle out after that, Krunal Pandya & Co. pulled through. They will fancy their chances once again given the conditions that are expected. LSG's home record wasn't great but they are a team that's used to playing on surfaces that are slow in nature.
MI, on the other hand, have been using their batting might this season to pick up victories. That batting, though, unit did struggle in the contest at Chepauk and they will have to learn and adapt this time around. Marcus Stoinis came up with a stunning effort when these two sides met just a week ago and Nicholas Pooran delivered in their last league game. But LSG need contributions from that top order.
When:
LSG vs MI, Eliminator, May 24, 2023 at 19:30 IST
Where:
MA Chidambaram stadium, Chennai
What to expect:
A humid evening awaits the two sides. Given how the par scores dipped at Chepauk in the second half, even a score of 150 could be a match-winning one.

With LSG struggling to find an opening partner for Quinton de Kock, there is a case to recall Kyle Mayers in place of Naveen-ul-Haq. On this surface, Amit Mishra will fancy his chances of being used as an impact sub.
Probable XI:
Kyle Mayers, Quinton de Kock (WK), Prerak Mankad, Marcus Stoinis, Krunal Pandya (C), Nicholas Pooran, Ayush Badoni, K Gowtham, Ravi Bishnoi, Mohsin Khan, Yash Thakur
Tactics & Matchups:
LSG would dearly love Stoinis to bat deep once again given his extraordinary record against MI's designated death bowler Chris Jordan. Stoinis has hammered a mind-boggling 151 runs against Jordan off just 61 balls. If Rohit does get past the new ball spell, LSG would still fancy their chances against the MI skipper given the success both Mishra and Bishnoi have had against him.
Mumbai Indians
The amount of left-handers in the LSG XI might prompt MI to bring back Hrithik Shokeen. Tilak Varma, who was named a sub for the last game, should make the cut as well.
Probable XI:
Rohit Sharma (C), Ishan Kishan (WK), Cameron Green, Suryakumar Yadav, Tilak Varma/Vishnu Vinod, Nehal Wadhera, Tim David, Chris Jordan, Piyush Chawla, Akash Madhwal, Hrithik Shokeen
Tactics & Matchups:
If LSG do field both the leggies, MI's best chance of countering them will be via Suryakumar Yadav and Cameron Green. The two players hardly get dismissed by legspinners and also strike the ball close to 140.
Did you know:
- Suryakumar's T20 career strike rate is over 150. But it drops down to 127 at Chepauk.
- Amit Mishra and Ravi Bishnoi combined have bowled 29 deliveries to Ishan Kishan, dismissing him on six occasions.
