A low-scoring last-ball thriller, followed by a high-scoring humdinger! Just the perfect dose of entertainment to get your weekend rolling. We hope you had great fun following both the games. Another double-header lined-up tomorrow. First up, RCB taking on the Rajasthan Royals followed by KKR v CSK at the Eden Gardens. Expecting a sell-out at both venues. As ever, do remember to tune in early for all the IPL action. Until then, cheers and goodbye from
Raju Peethala, Akshay Maanay, Abhinav Guha
and
Venky AV.
"
We are playing in Mumbai on Saturday, it's a good wicket out there and we're excited to play over there
," were Sam Curran's exact words after his team's loss to RCB at Mohali on Thursday and boy, did his team do justice to their skipper's excitement! Thanks to this win, Punjab have now moved into the top half of the table. Mumbai, on the other hand, slipped to 7th spot with 3 wins from 6 games.
Sam Curran | PBKS skipper and Player of the Match:
Pretty special. What an amazing ground. The environment is incredible here. It (the win) is a massive positive for us. I don't think I should be getting the Man of the Match considering how the boys closed the game out there. Without Shikhar, we know we had to take that responsibility. Our group is coming together really well. Shikhar will be fit soon. We won 4 out of the 7 games and it is not a bad place to be. Have got great support from the management and the local guys. The boys are enjoying themselves, and it is still a long way to go and the important thing is enjoy the game and don't put too much pressure on ourselves.

Arshdeep Singh:
Feels good whenever I take wickets. Right now I feel even happier as the team won. I have shortened my run-up as it helped me with the no-ball problem and I am enjoying my cricket at the moment. Danny (Morrison) you should come and stand next to me (when bowling the final over), the heartbeat is not even close to 120.
Rohit Sharma | MI skipper:
(On their death bowling) Yes, a little disappointment there, we made some errors in the field which can happen, not gonna look too much into that. Just keep our heads high, we have won three and lost three, pretty even-stevens at the moment. There is a lot of time left in the tournament. We can't look down and start worrying about things. Yes, we didn't come out on top today. We made some errors but something to go back and look into. (On Green and Sky) Quite happy with the way those two guys batted today and they kept us in the game till the end. Credit to Arshdeep the way he bowled in the last couple of overs.

Blimey! What a cracking game.
Just 11 runs and 3 wickets from Arshdeep Singh's last 2 overs.
In such high-scoring thrillers, you need someone with a calm head and of course a bit of experience as well. Arshdeep was at the receiving end a few times and today he had the opportunity to redeem himself. Yes, his wickets column and the method of dismissals might make you go wow, but the game-changing moment arrived when Arshdeep took a pause before delivering the 4th ball off the 18th over. He conceded 6 off the first ball and was under huge pressure before bowling his first ball to Mumbai's number 4. SKY, by then, smoked his fastest IPL fifty and was in no mood to relent. Arshdeep made SKY wait, switched to round the wicket and denied room for SKY on both sides of the wicket. He bowled a dipping full toss at the pads and messed up with the timing. Taide, indeed, deserves a huge chunk of credit for that moment, but it allowed Arshdeep to close the over out on a high. 6 off the 1st ball and just 3 off the next 5 balls. Cam Green, David and Rohit chipped in with useful contributions, but Arshdeep's grit and smartness triumphed all such flashes of brilliance. Stick around for  the post-match reactions...

Arshdeep Singh to Nehal Wadhera,
out
Bowled!! That is a carbon copy of Tilak Varma's dismissal. Just that Nehal Wadhera walked down the pitch a little and made it look that much more difficult.
Once again the middle stump has been broken.
Arshdeep Singh loads it full and pins the base of middle peg. Nehal with his hopeful shuffle-down-bat-swing had no chance. Will he get a hat-trick now?

Arshdeep Singh to Tilak Varma,
out
Bowled!! The middle stump is broken into two pieces. Arshdeep Singh goes full and straight, Tilak Varma looks to swing hard and straight and loses shape in the process. Sneaks through the gate and hits the timber. This is Punjab's game to lose from here...

Arshdeep Singh to Tilak Varma, no run, it's a dot ball! Gold, absolute gold. As good as picking a wicket at this stage of the game. Arshdeep Singh goes for the bumper and gets the ball to sail over the swinging blade of Tilak Varma. He went down on one knee looking for the lap/scoop and couldn't get anywhere near it...

18.4
Nathan Ellis to Tim David, 2 runs, okay! What is happening here? Sam Curran is having a chat with the umpire. Nathan Ellis nails the yorker and Tim David squeezes it straight back, hits the stumps at the bowler's end and it deflects into the vacant mid-wicket pocket. Tilak and Ellis collided with each other, Curran gestured to the umpire that there was a shove from Tilak on his bowler, but nothing doing, two more..

Arshdeep Singh to Suryakumar Yadav,
out
Caught by Atharva Taide!! Is that a match-winning catch? SKY is stunned. Sam Curran is chuffed to bits. Arshdeep Singh goes round the wicket and offers a dipping full toss at the stumps, SKY looks to whip it on the leg-side and doesn't get the desired timing on it. Skews it off the thick inside half to the left of mid-wicket and Taide takes a beauty. He hops across and sticks his left palm out, moments later he spots the ball nestle safely into his mitts.

, SKY special! You keep watching it time and again and the only reaction that could do justice to this shot is
WOW!
Absolute disdain. Picks up the
136ks
short ball off his hip and whiplashes it deep into the fine leg stands. Soon as the ball went up in the air, the fielder at fine leg - Ellis - didn't even bother to track the ball. He knew it was take a while before they fetch the ball and keep trundling in to the other end....

Dipen
: Green is slowing down, Mi still have wickets left, he should take more charge.
Timeout!
Remember Punjab scored 96 off the last five overs. Mumbai now need 83 from the last six overs. The surface looks to be getting slightly better and Mumbai will hope one of these two to convert this into a match-winning knock

Prabhsimran has been substituted and Ellis comes in as the Impact player for PBKS

21:20 Local Time, 15:50 GMT, 21:20 IST:
What a turnaround this has been for PBKS! They were struggling at the halfway stage but finished with a bang in the death overs, looting 96 off the last 5 overs. After being put into bat on a good-looking surface, PBKS had a false start as Short failed to make a mark, falling softly to Green. The young duo of Prabhsimran and Atharva stitched a 47-run stand and played some good looking shots but Arjun Tendulkar bamboozled the former with a peach of a yorker. Chawla further dented the visitors in the 10th over, getting rid of the dangerous Livingstone and the well-set Taide. Curran and Harpreet Singh took their time initially but once they got their eye in, they lit up Wankhede with eye-catchy strokes. The real difference was the 16th over as Arjun was taken for 31 runs. Green also conceded 25 in the 18th over and there was no stopping the carnage. Jitesh also played a bilnder in the slog overs to take PBKS past 200. It will certainly be a test for MI but the pitch is a belter and the boundaries are short. Join us shortly for the chase..

out
Bowled!! Second in the over for Chawla. What an IPL he is having? Punjab Kings have lost their way after a good powerplay. Quicker and at the stumps, Taide shuffles and misses the sweep, the ball strikes him on the pad and then deflects off the arm onto the stumps. Chawla was going up for a LBW appeal but saw what the ball had done and was delighted.

out
Stumped!! This is smart bowling from Chawla. He knew Livingstone wanted to have a piece of him and would come charging down, so he fired it down leg. Livingstone tried to get his pad across or something to deflect the ball away but is beaten by the pace, Ishan Kishan collects it well behind the wicket and dives to light up the stumps. That was brilliant bit of work from Ishan as well because he had to move a long way to his left.

Arjun Tendulkar to Prabhsimran,
out
Lbw!! That's an excellent yorker from Arjun. He showed in the previous game about how consistently he can nail 'em in the blockhole and now has Prabhsimran caught right in front. This pinpoint and Prabhsimran cannot bring his bat down, the ball sneaks through and strikes the back boot, the impact was in front of middle and ball-tracking showed it to be crashing into the base of middle-stump. Gaffaney took his time but made the right call.

The merry-go-round for the opening slots continue for Punjab Kings. Just tells you how big a miss Shikhar has been. Short is back opening after batting at number 3 in the last game. Arjun Tendulkar has the new white ball. He is at the top of the mark as the countdown begins. 3..2..1..PLAY
Jason Behrendorff:
The camp is great, everyone has got a nice smile and we are having a lot of fun while playing, that is the difference. We found some combinations that are starting to work and that is turning into good performances. He is a good fellow Bondy, I have known him for a while and he has a good philosophy on fast bowling, great to have him. This tournament is bigger than it has ever been. Great to be back in the IPL and I have had some consistent performances in the last couple of years.
Nathan Ellis:
We are without Shikhar, we lack experience in our batting line up and it showed in the last game, but we nearly got there despite losing early wickets and for us to get close, it was a good performance. In the games that we have lost, we haven't put our best performance but still got close, today we will try to put our best foot forward. I am hoping there's a little bit in it, you get a little bit of extra bounce here and outside of that, they have a good batting line up and hopefully we restrict them to a reasonable total. We bounce off each other really well and we don't overcomplicate things, you can do that in T20 tournaments and hopefully put up a good performance.

Sam Curran:
Back to back games and not much time to think about it. No Shikhar, that's why I am here but he's recovering and should be back soon. Great opportunity for the others to put their hand and we are going with the same team. Lot of close games for us. We would have bowled as well, that is the trend but hopefully we do well. Have a good powerplay and then take it from there.
Rohit Sharma:
We are going to have a bowl first. Really nice to have some wins under the belt, winning is always nice and the atmosphere is good but the job is not done. Quite surprisingly nice and pleasant. Looking forward to this game. We have had some injuries but
Jofra is back
and that is the only change. Wankhede is a good pitch to bat on and it gets better as the game goes on, hopefully we restrict them and chase it down later.
Mumbai Indians have won the toss and have opted to field
Pitch and Conditions:
"It is not the biggest ground going around; 65 meters one side and 59 on the other, downtown 75. The batters will be mindful of the dimensions. It looks like a very very good batting track but the fast men could be the ones to watch out for tonight. It is a great ground to bat on and it is a chasing ground. No dew, I don't think," reckon Matthew Hayden and Danny Morrison
Punjab Kings are back to their inconsistent best. They started the campaign with two wins out of two but have won only one in their last four games. Having regular skipper Dhawan out with injury has not helped either as the top order has looked shaky. Their opening stands in the last four games - 0, 0, 0, 4. This has left the middle order exposed and Rajapaksa's absence is a big miss as well. But Livingstone is back and Dhawan too has an outside chance to play as an impact sub where he can only bat. The Kings will look at these positives and try to get that win which will keep them close to the teams in front of them in the table. Toss and teams coming up..
18:30 Local Time, 13:00 GMT:
Mumbai Indians have taken off after their usual slow start to the season. They have won three in a row and currently placed sixth in the points table. It has been quite a turnaround after losing their first two games convincingly. The jigsaw pieces are falling in place; Rohit and Ishan have got 50+ scores in the last few games, SKY too has looked to be getting back to his best while Tilak Varma has been their standout batter. The four overseas Aussie players are starting to get a hang of the competition and Piyush Chawla has wounded the clock back. If Archer comes back then it will be a big boost for this high-flying Mumbai Indians team.

Mumbai Indians' IPL 2023 campaign is back on track. Three wins on the bounce in five games is not a bad start that the five-time champions. After two reversals upfront, the situation appears rose-tinted for the Rohit Sharma side. All hunky dory. Why not?
Ishan Kishan has started firing on all cylinders; Suryakumar Yadav has regained his imperious touch; Cameron Green and Tim David are doing their jobs impeccably, Riley Meredith and Jason Behrendorff are bowling well in tandem, veteran Piyush Chawla is being at his wily best, unleashing all his experience to fox the batters and even rookie Arjun Tendulkar has started being penetrative as well as restrictive.
It is such a pleasant situation that few remember that Rohit has only one half-century across formats in 12 innings. But then there can be little complaints about the skipper's form. He has been providing blazing starts with the bat and the rest of the team is able to exploit that. Mumbai Indians, suddenly, seem to have got their mojo back.
"The team is gelling together really nicely. All the top six batters have had an impact. So that's a very exciting thing for us. Guys are getting some quality game time. The main thing for us is to keep looking to get that little bit better in each game. We have won a couple of games now and we'll just try to continue to build on that momentum," said Behrendorff, who has taken up the responsibility of spearheading the bowling in the absence of Jofra Archer.
The Archer situation has become a sort of mystery. He was initially left out of a game as a precaution but has not played four games on the trot since. On Friday, the eve of Mumbai Indians' sixth match, against Punjab Kings, the Barbados-born English bowler was absent from the practice session. "It is an optional practice day," said a team official. It's not certain if he would be available for Saturday's game at the Wankhede.
"He has been training strongly. The medical team is working tirelessly. We are waiting for the medical team to tick off (all boxes). Hopefully, he is not far away (from being fully fit)," said Behrendorff on Friday. It's a fact that Archer's participation has become uncertain but he is certainly not being missed by the team. The rest of the bowlers, including Tendulkar Jr, seems to be doing their job commendably.
The situation is totally opposite for Punjab Kings, who have lost way after a fine start. They won the first two games and managed only one more in the next four and are in danger of slipping into the position of being perennial underachievers of the IPL.
The team needs Shikhar Dhawan on the top, something Harbhajan Singh rightly said. "The Punjab side seems largely dependent on their captain Shikhar Dhawan in the batting department which is a concern. While depending on one player, you can win two or three matches but you cannot win a tournament like the IPL. The rest of Punjab players will have to support their captain and take responsibility if they wish to go forward," the former India spinner recently said of the Mohali side.
The Punjab Kings have got a quality batsman in Matthew Short but they need Liam Livingston to fire in the middle overs besides hoping that Kagiso Rabada will be fine to take the field. The South African was reportedly under the weather for the home game against Royal Challengers Bangalore on Thursday. He has travelled to Mumbai and a team official said he is expected to be fit for Friday's game. The Punjab side needs him badly.
When:
Saturday, April 22 at 19:30 IST
Where:
Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai
What to expect:
The possibility of dew could play a factor in influencing the decision at the toss. The pitch, and the ground size, has aided batters a touch particularly early in the season.
Head to head:
Mumbai Indians 15 - 14 Punjab Kings
Head to head:
Team combinations
Mumbai Indians:
The team looks settled and there are unlikely to be any changes unless Jofra Archer gets fit and is ready to return to action. One of Jason Behrendorff and Riley Meredith could make way in that case.
Tactics and match-ups: Mumbai's experienced batters pulling their weight will be one of the targets heading into the game. For Rohit, this could be an uphill task against a bowling line-up that is stacked with bowlers that are not his first choice - left-arm pace and the ball turning away. Since 2019, he has been dismissed 21 times to this, and the likes of Arshdeep, Curran, Chahar and Harpreet Brar could be challenges.
Probables:
Rohit Sharma, Ishan Kishan, Suryakumar Yadav, Cameron Green, Tilak Varma, Tim David, Arjun Tendulkar, Nehal Wadhera, Hrithik Shokeen, Piyush Chawla, Jason Behrendoff
PBKS:
With spinners Rahul Chahar and Harpreet Brar doing well, one possible change is Kagiso Rabada coming in place of Nathan Ellis. There is an outside chance of Shikhar Dhawan coming in as an impact player, to bat.
Tactics and match-ups: Kagiso Rabada could find his way back into the eleven particularly since his good match-up against the likes of Rohit Sharma and Suryakumar Yadav. He has dismissed the former twice in 26 balls and the latter thrice in 40 bals.
Probables:
Atharva Taide, Prabhsimran Singh, Matthew Short, Liam Livingstone, Harpreet Singh Bhatia, Sam Curran, Jitesh Sharma, Shahrukh Khan, Harpreet Brar, Nathan Ellis/Kagiso Rabada, Arshdeep Singh, Rahul Chahar
Did you know:
-Teams chasing have won 11 of the last 14 matches at the Wankhede Stadium including the last five in a row
- Shikhar Dhawan accounted for more than 1/3rd of the total team runs for Punjab in the four matches he played
What they said:
If I bowl my fours overs upfront and would then be able to walk off, it would be nice, wouldn't it? I think it is a good opportunity to give guys games. We had the same with Rohit when he was under the weather. Those sorts of impacts are really beneficial for the game -

We'll come back on Saturday. We are playing in Mumbai on Saturday, it's a good wicket out there and we're excited to play over there -
