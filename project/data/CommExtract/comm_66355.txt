A much needed win for CSK. This should calm the nerves after going three games without a win. This result takes them to second and just a point behind leaders Gujarat Titans. MI came into this encounter having chased 200+ in consecutive games but it was their batting that let them down. They still have four games in hand though and plenty of time to correct their mistakes. That's all from this game. But the second match between DC and RCB is starting soon. Switch tabs and catch all the action. See you there..
Matheesha Pathirana was the top performer in today's game and we had him as a player to watch out for in our expert XI. Did you have him in your fantasy team? Follow #FantasyHandbook' on Cricbuzz Plus for more such useful information
Matheesha Pathirana | Player of the Match:
My journey with CSK started from last year, I came in as a replacement and played only two games, but this season I am playing more and I am happy. They (team management) give me a lot of confidence. This is my best bowling figures in T20 cricket and I am happy with the performance. I am a die hard fan of Cristiano Ronaldo (referring to his celebrations after picking a wicket).
MS Dhoni | CSK captain:
It was a very crucial game for a simple reason, if you see the points table there's a muddle in the middle. Last few games the results have not gone in our favour and so it is good to be on the winning side. I was doubtful with the decision at the toss, I wanted to bat first but the think tank thought about the rain, I was slightly outnumbered and so we went with the majority. If there is some kind of a confusion then we sit and talk about it. I felt the wicket will slow down and that was the reason behind it, and even if rain comes then the majority of the game would have been done. People who don't have a very clean action batters find it difficult to pick them. It is not the pace or variations, but the consistency. I would prefer him not to play red-ball cricket and play all the ICC tournaments, he would be a great asset for Sri Lanka. He was slightly lean last season and has added muscle this season.
Rohit Sharma | MI captain:
Everywhere I guess (on what went wrong), we didn't bat well enough, didn't put enough runs for the bowlers to defend. We had an off-day as a batting unit. We just did what we felt was comfortable (on him going down to 3), needed an Indian batter to bat in the middle overs against spin after unfortunately losing Tilak Varma, but we lost three wickets for just 16 runs. He's bowling really well (on Piyush Chawla), the other bowlers need to rally around him, that's what the team needs, everyone has to come forward and chip in contributions. There's no such home advantage this season, everyone has won and lost at home, we need to do all the three departments of the game, we'll play at home in the next two games, we'll see how it goes.
Ruturaj Gaikwad:
Spending a lot of time with him (Conway) off the field as well. We're going along well. Would like to continue the same. We try to continue the positive intent in the powerplay because the wicket was on the slower side. Good start from the bowling unit as well. Wicket wasn't slow in the first half. Fleming would be happy about that (50th catch in T20s for Gaikwad).

19:03 Local Time, 13:33 GMT:
IPL's own El Clasico has not lived up to the expectation this season, not at Wankhede and certainly not at Chepauk. Both have been convincing victories for CSK. The result was almost decided when MI were restricted to 139 and the only way to make a match of it was to get early wickets which didn't happen. Gaikwad got the hosts off to a flier by smashing Arshad Khan for 20 runs in an over and from thereon the asking rate was below 6. Conway anchored the innings while the rest of the batters chipped in with cameos. The only shining spot for MI with the ball was Chawla's continued good form as he picked two of the four wickets to fall. Hang around for the presentations..
STAT
: Only the second instance of CSK beating MI in both league games in a season, the first having come in 2014.

Won by MI: 1
17.4
Arshad Khan to Dhoni, 1 run,
CSK win by 6 wickets.
He does it in a calm and controlled manner. Short and around the hips, Dhoni pulls it backward of square leg and jogs to the other end. MI's dominance at Chepauk has come to an end -
CSK’s first win vs MI at Chepauk since 2011
17.3
Arshad Khan to Shivam Dube, 1 run, just listen to the cheer. Wow! Slower ball and Dube bashes it down to long-on. Dhoni is on strike and he has the chance to score the winning runs. Will he finish it off in style?
17.2
Arshad Khan to Shivam Dube,
SIX
, is Dube going to deny Dhoni the strike? But this was a bad ball and had to be put away, short and down leg, Dube swivels and helps the pull over fine leg. Just 2 needed
17.1
Arshad Khan to Shivam Dube, no run, slower ball bowled into the surface, Dube is early into the pull and misses

16.4
Akash Madhwal to Dhoni, no run, good length ball around off, Dhoni defends it in front of cover
MS Dhoni, right handed bat, comes to the crease
The decibel levels at Chepauk are going off the roof. MS Dhoni has walked out to the middle. They were chanting his name when Dube walked out and he doesn't disappoint his fans, does he?
16.3
Akash Madhwal to Conway,
out
Lbw!! That was a good review from Madhwal. Rohit wasn't sure and kept asking where did the ball hit, Madhwal told him it was pad and the decision was referred. Conway shuffles across, crouches down and misses the lap/scoop, the ball sneaks past everything and smashes into the back leg. Hitting middle of middle-stump.
Conway lbw b Akash Madhwal 44(42) [4s-4]
Akash Madhwal to Conway,
THATS OUT!!
Lbw!!
MI review!
Conway is all over the place as he attempts the lap. Madhwal appeals for LBW and the umpire is not convinced. He convinces Rohit to send it upstairs. Was it off the pad? Was it off the glove? UltraEdge has a flat line. Madhwal might have a wicket here. Yes, three reds and Conway is OUT
16.2
Akash Madhwal to Shivam Dube, 1 run, short and banged into the pitch, Dube pulls to deep square leg
16.1
Akash Madhwal to Conway, 1 run, backs away and Madhwal follows him, Conway drops it near his feet and Dube sprints to the other end

12.5
Tristan Stubbs to Rayudu,
out
Caught by Raghav Goyal!! Stubbs has his man. Rayudu has a smile on his face as he can't believe he has hit that straight to the fielder. Flatter and sliding across, Rayudu tries to slice the cut through the vacant backward point region but ends up picking out Raghav at short third.

Tristan Stubbs to Rayudu,
THATS OUT!!
Caught!!
12.4
Tristan Stubbs to Rayudu,
SIX
, this was coming. Rayudu wasn't going to allow Stubbs get away with 1s and 2s. He shimmies down the wicket, does not quite get to the pitch but goes through with the loft, gets enough power and clears deep mid-wicket
Aditya
: With such an intense fight for the playoffs I expected Chennai to go all out with the kind of start they got. They have surely missed a trick here by promoting Rayudu over Dube given his form and how well he plays spin.
12.3
Tristan Stubbs to Conway, 1 run, missed out there. Full toss down leg and Conway had premeditated the sweep, laps it to short fine and a fumbe gives the pair a single

Timeout!
CSK are in the driver's seat even though they lost Rahane. The asking rate is well below 6 and there's plenty of batting to be left. For MI, the concerning part is that Chawla is the only bowler that has looked like taking a wicket and he has just an over left.

Chawla to Rahane,
out
Lbw!! That was poor from Conway. Rahane was ready to walk away but Conway made him challenge the decision. This was the googly and Rahane for once did not pick, he lunged forward and tried to defend outside the line, the ball beats the inside edge and smashes him right in front of the stumps. Easy decision for the umpire and technology also proves him right.
Rahane lbw b Chawla 21(17) [4s-1 6s-1]
Chawla to Rahane,
THATS OUT!!
Lbw!!
CSK review!
Rahane is given out LBW. He has a long chat with Conway and reviews with 2 seconds left. That looked plumb. Only the impact can save him. But that too looks to be within the stumps. UltraEdge rules out bat. Some delay with ball-tracking technology. We have the pitching and impact, both reds, but are waiting to see if it is hitting the stumps or not. Here it is.. Smashing into the top of middle-stump. OUT!
8.5
Chawla to Rahane, no run, attacks the stumps with a wrong 'un, Rahane stays back and tucks it to mid-wicket

8.2
Chawla to Rahane,

, just a chip and the ball sails over long-on. Chawla overcooks the googly and lands it right in the slot, Rahane does not try to overhit but just times the loft and watches it clear Green

7.5
Raghav Goyal to Rahane, no run, leg-lined delivery and Rahane misses the tuck to the on-side, struck on the pad

Jayant Singh
: The way Chawla has reinvented himself is commendable. He was present in the Star Sports studio last season but today he is making a strong presence of middle on the field. Chawla is Rohit Sharma's most trusted bowler today, no doubt about it.
6.2
Chawla to Rahane, 1 run, googly around off, Rahane picks it right out of the hand and works it to long-on

Chawla to Rahane,

out
Caught by Ishan Kishan!! Chawla strikes with his first ball! He's getting wickets even with half-trackers now! Dragged down short on off, Gaikwad looks to pull but it loops off a thick top-edge for a simple catch to the keeper. May have stopped on him a touch as he went for the pull.

Tushar Deshpande:
The surface looks good. Initially it was a bit slow but as the day has gone by it is getting better. The plan was normal of hitting top of off-stump, just bowl attacking lengths and don't overthink what the batter is going to do. Just back your strengths and be aggressive in your mindset. We just have to bat well and I can't say much about batting.

17:14 Local Time, 11:44 GMT, 17:14 IST:
MI have been restricted to 139 on what seems a stoppy pitch in Chennai. Was an innings that never really took flight after being rocked early in the powerplay. Green was promoted to open, Rohit came in at three. But both of them, along with Kishan, were dismissed inside three overs with Chahar and Deshpande striking early. From there the innings got stuck in the rebuilding phase. Wadhera played well to lead a recovery with his 64 off 51 balls, with some support along the way from Surya and Stubbs. But barring a couple of expensive overs, none of them were allowed to really get away. Even the final three overs produced just 17 with Pathirana being brilliant again. Outstanding figures of 3/15 for him today. Let's see how CSK go about on this pitch though. Back shortly.

Pathirana to Chawla, 2 runs, slower one pitched up outside off, Chawla slices it in the air off the toe-end and it falls in a gap at point. Maybe there should've been a dive from Moeen to go for the catch, not sure. Chawla gets back for two

out
Caught by Jadeja!! Really good catch from Jadeja. A slower one floated up outside off, Stubbs is early through the shot and skies it off the toe-end. There's some ground to cover for Jadeja at extra cover, he moves across nicely, doesn't quite get into the best position and has to stretch out for the ball with both hands. Still manages to grab it.

Chahar to Rohit,
out
Caught by Jadeja!! Another duck for Rohit and his bad patch continues. So, MS has outfoxed him once again, he came up to the stumps and Rohit thought he could play the lap, the shot was on, but Rohit's in such poor form that he's through with the shot way too early, the ball caught the shoulder of the bat, clipped his thumb and then lobbed up towards gully. RJ came in from backward point and holds onto a simple catch.

out
Caught by Theekshana!! .. and he falls next ball. Horrid from Kishan, on a good length and just outside off - he prodded across and was then looking to heave it onto the shorter leg-side boundary, a big top-edge that went many a mile in the air, Theekshana has plenty of time underneath the skier and he holds on with ease at mid-on. MI have lost both openers and are in a spot of bother now.

out
Bowled!! Deshpande strikes once again and he's on a roll - short of a good length and angling into the right-hander, was short enough for Green to play the pull, but this ball didn't bounce a lot and skid underneath his bat, smashes into the top of off-stump and MI have lost their opening wicket cheaply once again.

Rohit Sharma
: Going pretty well, had a couple of good games, just about continuing the momentum. We have some worries, but we've started to do well. It's been challenging to find the right players and the right combinationbs. We know our strengths and the players who can fit in. Two changes for is - Kumar Kartikeya is OUT, a debut for Raghav Goyal.
Tilak Varma is slightly injured, he's replaced by Tristan Stubbs.
(Changes tactical or forced?) Tacttical.
MS Dhoni:
We'll bowl first. A bit of rain expected, that's one reason, looks like a good wicket and we want them to set a target for us. Every individual has worked well, everyone can show some attention on the field, we've improved every game, there have been some slip ups, but we need to finish well. We're playing with the same squad
Chennai Super Kings have won the toss and have opted to field
Ajinkya Rahane
: Enjoying my batting now. The domestic season was quite good, I batted well. Trying to learn something everyday. The format is such that you have to grow all the time. Management and captain have given me role clarity. That gives a certain freedom. I was told at the start of the season what my role will be. I was given the freedom to play my game. Every year you can see the improvement in this league - be it in individual players or teams.
Our man, Narbhavi Rajendran, is at the ground and he's sent us this update: 'Not quite like the yellow wave you usually see at the Wankhede when CSK pay a visit but I can still spot plenty of blue shirts already inside the stadium 90 mins before the game. It's been overcast for a while now. Nothing threatening but the lights are already switched on.'
'It's a pretty big ground, but there is a short boundary at one side (61m), the other square boundary is at 70m and the straight boundary is 73m. The pitch is hard as a rock, the cracks are less this time around, it's a high-scoring ground this year with a lot of 200+ scores. It's a good batting pitch, but it'll be a touch slow and a touch low, especially against the brand new ball. It's sweaty and overcast, so the captain winning the toss would want to bat second,' reckon
Pommie Mbangwa and Aaron Finch
, in his pitch report
2:15 pm local
: It's the weekend and we have four exciting matches coming up, the first being a huge clash between traditional rivals, Chennai Super Kings and Mumbai Indians. The two teams have shared 9 trophies between them, the rivalry is unparalleled and today afternoon could perhaps be the last of the famed Dhoni v Rohit captaincy tussle. It's also a big weekend, the four matches could go a long way in deciding the playoff berths. It's a cloudy day in Chennai, but the rain is expected to stay away and we should have a full game. CSK and MI are placed 3rd and 6th in the standings, but they're separated by a mere one point, with CSK having played one extra match. Chepauk has changed from its traditional spin friendly surfaces to ones that have assisted strokeplay, which could work perfectly for the visitors, who come into the game on the back of two back-to-back successful 200+ run chases.

It's been almost a month since Chennai Super Kings and Mumbai Indians faced off at the Wankhede. Quite interestingly, the surface played to CSK's strengths as they walked out winners comfortably. The spin duo of Ravindra Jadeja and Mitchell Santner caused damage with the ball and Ajinkya Rahane's renaissance kickstarted on the same evening. And now 48 games into the tournament, the two teams are pretty much in the same territory. CSK have played an extra game and have an extra point at their disposal. However, their form has been contrasting. Mumbai Indians are on a high after chasing down targets over 200 twice in their last two games and CSK have not won in their last three.
CSK definitely need a win now. They aren't in dangerous territory but a fourth straight game without a win might easily set panic in the camp with the race for playoff spots intensifying. This contest will kickstart a home run for the four-time champions that will see them play their next three games at Chepauk.
Winning all three isn't straightforward though despite their proud home record. This season, they have already been defeated twice here and their head coach Stephen Fleming admitted that they are still trying to get used to the conditions having not played here a lot in recent years. The fact that the wickets haven't aided spin as much as they were expected to has complicated matters.
Two wins in a single season over their arch-rivals MI is a rarity for CSK. Since returning in 2018, CSK haven't beaten MI at home. They certainly have an opportunity now on Saturday to correct that record but they would love a bit of home advantage in terms of the pitch to aid them in their bid.
MI on the other hand would hope for a batting beauty given how their batting lineup has fared recently. Suryakumar Yadav has returned to his best, Cameron Green and Ishan Kishan have been chipping in, Tilak Varma has looked impressive and Tim David has been providing the finishing touch. Rohit Sharma did have a long session at the nets before the game and the five-time champions would hope their skipper ends his lean run in style.
When:
CSK vs MI, May 6 at 15:30 IST
Where:
MA Chidambaram Stadium, Chennai
What to expect:
There could be some rain in the vicinity on match day. However, the sky is expected to be clear during noon. Doubts remain over the surface given we haven't really seen the spinners dominate at Chepauk.
Team Watch
Chennai Super Kings
There is a case for Mitchell Santner to replace Maheesh Theekshana in the XI. The New Zealand allrounder did pose problems when the teams faced each other last month and Theekshana has been leaking runs this season. MS Dhoni looked in great touch in the nets and there have been calls for him to bat at least ahead of Ravindra Jadeja.
Probable XI:
Devon Conway, Ruturaj Gaikwad, Ajinkya Rahane, Shivam Dube, Moeen Ali, MS Dhoni (C&WK), Ravindra Jadeja, Mitchell Santner/Maheesh Theekshana, Deepak Chahar, Matheesha Pathirana, Tushar Deshpande
Tactics & Matchups:
Suryakumar Yadav is in form and has a great record at Chepauk averaging over 40. However, he has struggled against left-arm spin post 2019. As a result, CSK would want to ensure they get Jadeja to bowl to him and probably even Santner if he gets a game. Ajinkya Rahane might not have a great reputation against spin but his strike rate against Piyush Chawla stands at 144.94.
Mumbai Indians
Hrithik Shokeen could force his way back into the XI given the amount of left-handers CSK have at their disposal.
Probable XI:
Rohit Sharma (C), Ishan Kishan (WK), Cameron Green, Suryakumar Yadav, Tilak Varma, Tim David, Nehal Wadhera, Hrithik Shokeen, Jofra Archer, Piyush Chawla, Akash Madhwal
Tactics & Matchups:
Piyush Chawla has been in great form this season. While he might not have a great record against Rahane as mentioned above, the leggie does have a favourable matchup against Dhoni, Jadeja and Rayudu.
Did you know:
- Ambati Rayudu hasn't had much to do this season but he does have a very good record against MI, averaging over 36 at a strike rate of 133.
- Rohit Sharma has a poor record against Ravindra Jadeja, scoring only 61 runs off 59 deliveries
Squads:
Chennai Super Kings
Squad: Ruturaj Gaikwad, Devon Conway, Ajinkya Rahane, Moeen Ali, Shivam Dube, Ravindra Jadeja, MS Dhoni(w/c), Deepak Chahar, Matheesha Pathirana, Tushar Deshpande, Maheesh Theekshana, Ambati Rayudu, Mitchell Santner, Subhranshu Senapati, Shaik Rasheed, Akash Singh, Dwaine Pretorius, RS Hangargekar, Sisanda Magala, Ajay Jadav Mandal, Prashant Solanki, Simarjeet Singh, Bhagath Varma, Nishant Sindhu
Mumbai Indians
Squad: Rohit Sharma(c), Ishan Kishan(w), Cameron Green, Tilak Varma, Tim David, Nehal Wadhera, Jofra Archer, Piyush Chawla, Kumar Kartikeya, Akash Madhwal, Arshad Khan, Suryakumar Yadav, Jason Behrendorff, Sandeep Warrier, Vishnu Vinod, Riley Meredith, Ramandeep Singh, Shams Mulani, Arjun Tendulkar, Hrithik Shokeen, Duan Jansen, Tristan Stubbs, Dewald Brevis, Raghav Goyal
