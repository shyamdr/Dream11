Faf managed a smile when he was quizzed after the game. That smile was all about being hapless. His bowlers haven't come to the party this season. A total of 200 wasn't that big but the bowlers just couldn't execute the slower balls. MI are a team on the way up and they have managed to get to 12 points. This is their third successful chase of 200 or more in this season. The first team to do so. RCB have slipped a little in the pack. But this roller coaster at the table will continue. We will be there to make it smooth for you! This is our team of
Nikhil JD, Abhinand Raghavendran, Kumar Abhisekh Das and Praveen
bidding you a temporary bye bye.
Suryakumar Yadav, Player of the Match:
Much needed from team's point of view. I am very happy to win a home game like this. I mean they come up with a plan. They tried to make me hit to the bigger part. Take the pace off and bowl slow. I said Nehal let's hit it hard and hit it into the gaps and run hard. Your practice has to be the same what you intend to do in matches. I know where my runs are. We have open net sessions. I know my game. I don't do anything different.
Rohit Sharma:
It is a good pitch. If you apply yourselves, you can get runs. Those four guys played well. Akash was with us last year as well. We saw the skillset. We wanted to give him a role. He is quite confident. He leads his Uttarakhand team. He knows what field he needs. We restricted them to less than 200. Was a great effort, It could have been 220 or more. I have no idea what a safe score is. The last four games we have seen excess of 200 has been scored. Most of the teams are taking risks and it is coming off. The batters are taking risks and 200 plus scores are being chased. The mindset of the batters is to do something special for the team and it is coming off as well.
Most successful 200+ chases in an IPL season
3 MI in 2023 *
2 PBKS in 2014
2 CSK in 2018
Winning with most balls to spare in a 200+ chases
21 balls: 200 by MI vs RCB Mumbai WS 2023
15 balls: 208 by DC vs GL Delhi 2017
10 balls: 201 by PBKS vs KKR Kolkata 2010
Nehal Wadhera:
It was fun batting up the order, earlier I was batting down. I got an opportunity to bat up and I got back-to-back fifties. I am happy with my fifty but I am more happy that my team won and I hope we continue to do so. I have the confidence within me that if I keep on batting till the end, I can finish the game for the team. Surya bhai is a top-class player and I also try to copy some of his shots but I cannot. While he was batting I was talking to him and he was saying 'keep playing, keep playing' and he was giving me confidence. He told me, 'If both of us bat till the 15th-16th over, we can finish the game even early.' And that's what we did. The previous game which I played against CSK, I played a scoop. Earlier I didn't play, after seeing Surya bhai bat, I also learned from him and I am very happy.
Faf du Plessis:
I think we were at least 20 runs short, in context of the wicket. They are a strong chasing team and they bat deep. We didn't capitalise in the last five overs, disappointed due to the lack of runs in those five overs. You need to say 200 is a good score (to motivate the players), needed to make sure you take the pace off. They capitalized the first 6 overs with the pace on. He (SKY) is one of the best, when he gets going, it's difficult to shut him down. Siraj has been fantastic in the first half of IPL. He got away with it for a really long time, but the guys are going to come out and play positively. Towards the back end of the tournament when the wickets get slower, you need to make sure you are around 60 runs in the first 6 overs.

MI have thrashed RCB. More adjectives will follow when there is a post-mortem of this game. RCB just never arrived with the ball. They were found wanting. Kishan got MI off to a flier and set the tone. Hasaranga applied the brakes and picked up Kishan and Rohit in the same over. Nehal and SKY joined hands post that. Then there was clinical decimation. Everyone went to the cleaners. No one was spared. Nehal started off aggressively. But once SKY started, everyone took a back seat and just soaked in some amazing display of batting. RCB bowlers did help MI a little as well with their poor wayward bowling. Earlier, Faf and Maxi had played fine knocks to help put RCB 199 on the board. And has been the case in this tourney, RCB failed to put the finishing touches while batting. They could have scored 20 more but lost wickets at regular intervals in the last 7 overs. MI have jumped to number 3 in the table. RCB have slipped to 7. Their NRR hasn't been helped by this game as well. MI improve their own NRR but it is still in the negative. That won't be factor at all if they keep playing like this.
16.3
Harshal Patel to Nehal Wadhera,
SIX
,
MI win. Nehal gets a fifty!
If you don't know the meaning of shellacking. This chase defines it. That was a wide delivery, outside off, Nehal Wadhera throws his willow at it and slams it over cover. The southpaw now has back-to-back fifties and MI leapfrog to number 3 in the table...
16.2
Harshal Patel to Nehal Wadhera, no run, drops it short, angles the ball across, Nehal Wadhera looks to pull and misses. One more shot and it should be over

Vijaykumar Vyshak to Tim David,
out
Caught by Maxwell!! Checks his drive and finds the man at long-off. Was a slower delivery outside off and Tim David checked the lofted hit. That took out all the power and Maxi ran in to take it. Easy take for him. RCB delay the inevitable. Vijaykumar Vyshak is on a hat-trick. That was a well disguised slower delivery and Tim David was way too early into the shot.
Tim David c Maxwell b Vijaykumar Vyshak 0(1)
Vijaykumar Vyshak to Tim David,
THATS OUT!!
Caught!!
Tim David, right handed bat, comes to the crease
Time-out. How do I define this break? Three letters should be enough. SKY. Is there a more complete T20 batter than him? On his day he can bring you down alone. He has hurt RCB massively today. A target of 200 has been reduced to a dawdle now.

Vijaykumar Vyshak to Suryakumar Yadav,
out
Caught by Kedar Jadhav!! Ouch! That's the end as far as some wholesome entertainment was concerned. SKY goes. MI need 8 more only. Was a slower length delivery, Suryakumar Yadav wanted to drag the pull away but failed to time. The ball went really upwards and Jadhav under it was calm. He took it easily. He would wanted to finish it. But he got them to the doorsteps. Another hypnotizing knock from SKY ends.

Caught!!
Highest partnership for MI against RCB any wicket surpassing 122* between Pollard & Rayudu in Bengaluru in 2012
15.3
Vijaykumar Vyshak to Suryakumar Yadav,
SIX
, my fingers are bleeding! SKY is in a murderous mood. Was a full toss on the pads, Suryakumar Yadav gets inside the line of the delivery and whips it behind square for a sixer. Massive hit indeed. Only 8 needed now. RCB's NRR will take a massive beating...
15.2
Vijaykumar Vyshak to Suryakumar Yadav,
FOUR
, 14 needed now. Should be the last over IMHO. That was short, outside off, Suryakumar Yadav does a whirlwind with his bat and slashes it over point. The ball teased the man from point who was giving it a chase. Four more for SKY
15.2
Vijaykumar Vyshak to Suryakumar Yadav,
no ball
,
SIX
, he is in a hurry! RCB in a hurry to hand over the win as well. Another slippery high full toss. The batter gets inside the line of the ball and slams the scoop pull over fine leg. That went over the fence
15.1
Vijaykumar Vyshak to Nehal Wadhera, 1 run, fuller ball, outside off, drilled down to long-off for a single

Hasaranga to Nehal Wadhera, 1 run, gets that down to long-on for a single as that was a tossed up delivery outside off. 26 needed now. At this rate, two more overs and we should be done and dusted...
14.5
Hasaranga to Nehal Wadhera,
FOUR
, oh hang on! Nehal is there as well. Plays with an angled bat and pulls that past short fine for a four. Hasaranga completely losing the plot...
14.4
Hasaranga to Suryakumar Yadav, 1 run, drives the ball away and gets it down to deep cover for a single. Some sanity
14.3
Hasaranga to Suryakumar Yadav,
SIX
, how many adjectives are there to define BRILLIANCE? Or does the word SKY defines it alone. This man is making a mockery of the chase. Was a tossed up delivery, Suryakumar Yadav again crouched down to slammed the slog sweep over deep mid
14.2
Hasaranga to Suryakumar Yadav, 2 runs, gets a top-edge and the ball goes fine. That wasn't timed as he played the slog sweep a little too early. It went fine and they get a brace

: SKY..... Form is Temporary, Class is Permanent!!
14.1
Hasaranga to Suryakumar Yadav,
SIX
, he wants an early finish! SKY sends another one skywards. Was a tossed up delivery, Suryakumar Yadav sits down and slog sweeps it over deep backward square. Managed to beat the man at the fence quite easily

13.5
Siraj to Suryakumar Yadav, 1 run, too early into the pull and cue-ends the ball down to long-on for a single. Was way too early into the pull. Well delivered by Siraj

13.4
Siraj to Suryakumar Yadav, 2 runs, drives a fuller ball into the off-side and brings up his
fifty off 26 balls.
That was well placed for a brace. Wankhede brings out the best in SKY and again he is bossing another chase
13.3
Siraj to Suryakumar Yadav,
SIX
, plucking sixes in his backyard! Moves to 49 in style. Was a fuller ball, slower, Suryakumar Yadav packs a lot of power and slams it over long-on. Made of rubber but dishes out steel to the bowlers...
13.2
Siraj to Suryakumar Yadav,
FOUR
, looks for a lofted hit off a delivery outside off and the ball goes off the edge to speed away past the short third man fielder for a four. He wanted to hit it hard and hence edged it
13.1
Siraj to Suryakumar Yadav, no run, fuller length delivery, outside off, slower, Suryakumar Yadav looks to drive through the off-side and misses

12.6
Harshal Patel to Suryakumar Yadav, 1 run, walks across his sticks, picks the slower ball late and nudges the ball square on the on-side for a single. Good change of pace but Suryakumar Yadav is always the deliveries very late and that helps him to adjust his shots at the last moment
12.5
Harshal Patel to Suryakumar Yadav,
FOUR
, and that's a superb square drive! Cutter of a delivery outside off, Suryakumar Yadav waits on it and punches it past point. Such good timing from this man. He is unstoppable when he is in this moodd
12.4
Harshal Patel to Nehal Wadhera, 1 run, plays with an angled bat and nudges the ball down onto the on-side for a single
12.3
Harshal Patel to Nehal Wadhera,
FOUR

12.3
Harshal Patel to Nehal Wadhera,
no ball
, leg byes,
FOUR
, dipping slower ball, too high, Nehal Wadhera sat down to pull it and missed it. That was dangerously high and the ball went off the arms and very fine for four leg byes. Free-hit coming up as well
12.2
Harshal Patel to Suryakumar Yadav, 1 run, dipping slower delivery outside off, a sylvan hit down to deep mid for a single. Wasn't timed
12.1
Harshal Patel to Nehal Wadhera, 1 run, 75 needed off 47 balls doesn't look scary at all. Was a fuller ball, drilled down to long-off for a single. Kohli was quick to cut it off

11.6
Hazlewood to Suryakumar Yadav,
FOUR
, ho ho! SKY has been unleashed. It will rain runs now. That was a slower length delivery, Suryakumar Yadav got inside the line of the delivery and played the field by scooping it over short fine. Four to end the over and SKY moves to 33
11.5
Hazlewood to Suryakumar Yadav,
FOUR
, and this time he connects. Got the room, got the pace, plays the ramp shot late and fine for a four. He is a freaking genius
Armaan
: MI well on their way to win this if RCB don't nab quick wickets
11.4
Hazlewood to Suryakumar Yadav, no run, looks for a late slap over point. The ball decked in from a back of a length spot. The batter tried to crouch down low and then slash it. But the ball skidded through and the batter missed the line of the ball
11.3
Hazlewood to Nehal Wadhera, 1 run, slices a full toss down to long-off for a single as he failed to time it well
11.2
Hazlewood to Nehal Wadhera, no run, huge appeal from Hazlewood but they don't opt for the review. Was a slower length delivery, angled away a bit and Nehal Wadhera tried to pull it. But missed the line and was hit on the pads. That was missing the sticks
11.1
Hazlewood to Nehal Wadhera, no run, quicker length delivery. Angled across, Nehal Wadhera looked to dab it and was late on it. The ball was bowled at 128 clicks. But seemed that it skidded off after landing
11.1
Hazlewood to Nehal Wadhera,
wide
, slower delivery, outside off, angled across, left alone for it to be wided
Josh Hazlewood [2.0-0-22-0] is back into the attack
MI's future assets -- Kishan, Wadhera, Verma, Stubbs, Brevis, Green, David! This would be a serious batting fiesta in times to come. Especially at the Wankhede.

10.4
Hasaranga to Nehal Wadhera,
SIX

10.3
Hasaranga to Suryakumar Yadav, 1 run, and kneels down to get an edge. The ball was well flighted. The batter managed to get some wood and that saved him
10.2
Hasaranga to Suryakumar Yadav,
SIX
, SKY has exploded! That was sent packing over deep mid. Dropped short, innocuous delivery, Suryakumar Yadav jumped back and smashed it over deep mid. That went sailing over the fence
10.1
Hasaranga to Nehal Wadhera, 1 run, slaps that down to long-off by trekking back. Was hit well but straight to the fielder

8.6
Hasaranga to Nehal Wadhera, 1 run, nudges a tossed up delivery down to long-on for a single. RCB would be gutted. They created a chance in the over. But failed to make it count
8.5
Hasaranga to Suryakumar Yadav, 1 run, was on the sticks, tossed up, Suryakumar Yadav kneels down and sweeps it in front of square for a single
8.4
Hasaranga to Nehal Wadhera, 1 run, drilled!
Dropped.
Was shot back and the bowler failed to grab it with his fingers pointing frontwards. That was hit really hard and burst through the hands of the bowler. Was too full and the batter didn't get the elevation. The bowler was crouching down when he tried to grab it but there was too much of momentum on the ball
8.4
Hasaranga to Suryakumar Yadav,
2 wides
, 95 kph, down leg, Suryakumar Yadav missed that down leg and they earned two extra runs as the keeper also let it go
8.3

8.2
Hasaranga to Nehal Wadhera, no run, shortish, flatter, Nehal Wadhera chops the ball down into the off-side
I feel Hasaranga should have been given two overs on the bounce. Better late than never though.
8.1
Hasaranga to Suryakumar Yadav, 1 run, and a single to start the over. Was a flatter googly, Suryakumar Yadav went back to it and tucked it very late. Took it from the sticks

7.6
Vijaykumar Vyshak to Suryakumar Yadav, 1 run, fuller length delivery, drills the drive wide of long-off and they settle for a single. That could have been a brace. Was again so nicely timed. The sound coming off the bat is so pleasing
7.5
Vijaykumar Vyshak to Suryakumar Yadav, no run, short, wide, slashed and lands to the man at point on the bounce. Good diving stop by the point fielder to his left. The batter chased a wide one and one hand came off the handle but he timed it so sweetly. Can he ever ill-time anything in this mood?
7.4
Vijaykumar Vyshak to Suryakumar Yadav, 2 runs, waits on the short ball, times the pull and Suyash has to come up with a good dive to his left. That ensured it was a brace
7.3
Vijaykumar Vyshak to Suryakumar Yadav, no run, that was a slower length delivery and SKY tried to play his staple shot. Missed the line as he was done in by the lack of the pace. There was bounce on it and the impact was a little dodgy as well
RCB thought over it and have taken the review. Was a slower length delivery, the batter walked across, tried to stay inside the line of the ball and scoop it but missed the delivery. There is no bat. The impact will be the clincher. The impact and hitting, both are umpire's call.
7.2
Vijaykumar Vyshak to Suryakumar Yadav,
FOUR
, crashes that past point and manages to beat the man at deep cover for a four. That was short, wide, Suryakumar Yadav gets on top of the bounce and cuts it past point with aplomb
7.1
Vijaykumar Vyshak to Nehal Wadhera, 1 run, walks down the track and tucks the ball down to deep mid for a single. That angled into the batter
Time-out!
MI are coasting. But they have lost two wickets. But SKY is in and has got an able ally in Nehal Wadhera. RCB need more wickets. The rate needed might be close to 10 per over but Green, David and Jordan to follow. That's a lot of batting!!!

6.2
Harshal Patel to Suryakumar Yadav, 1 run, fuller length delivery, outside off, Suryakumar Yadav outer-halves the drive uppishly into the covers for a single. The bat face opened a tad on impact
6.1
Harshal Patel to Suryakumar Yadav,
FOUR
, poor from the man at deep mid! It is Virat. Sloppy from him as he was lazy to bend down and the ball slipped through his fingers for a four. That was a slower delivery and Suryakumar Yadav clipped that into the gap. The fielder got there, bent down, but failed to grab it perfectly
Harshal Patel, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attack
MI off to a good start barring those twin strikes. SKY and Nehal have the onus now.
Over summary (1-6)
-> Siraj concedes only 4 runs in his first over
-> Hazlewood concedes 15 runs in an over
-> Kishan off to a flying start, hits a 102 metre six!
-> Hasaranga breaks the partnership, Kishan is GONE!

Abhishek
: Looking into the days when Dinesh Karthik used to play for MI, I always bet on him with my elder brother to make 20-30 runs per inning consistently with a good strike rate. He was the best at this job. He was a silent killer and that is what he has done today.

Welcome back. RCB are in a huddle, Kohli doing the most of the talking and off they disperse. In walk the MI openers. Rohit is back at the top of the order but it's Ishan Kishan who's on strike. Siraj, with a smile on his face, has the new ball in his hand. A slip in place. Here we go...
Maxwell:
Spending time out there and having fun with Faf, it was enjoyable. I think it was around a 200-wicket, but there were a few balls that kept low. We are happy with that score. You try and play the conditions as much as you can. I was really committed today and super positive in my mindset. I tried to play the field and tried to back my instincts.

21:24 Local Time, 15:54 GMT, 21:24 IST:
Brilliant final over from Akash Madhwal, backed his yorkers and gave away just 6 runs after conceding 17 off his opening over. RCB, meanwhile, finish on 199. They didn't get off to an auspicious start as they lost Kohli and Anuj Rawat to Jason Behrendorff. The Australian pacer should have had Faf as well for a golden duck but Nehal Wadhera dropped a catch at mid-wicket. That turned out to be a costly drop as the RCB captain and Glenn Maxwell counterattacked. Both the overseas players notched up their fifties and the duo stitched their fourth 100+ stand of the season. Bangalore were 131/2 at the end of the 12th over and would have eyed a mammoth total but Mumbai fought back. They picked three wickets in three overs which included the scalps of both the set batters. DK scored a quickfire 30 but RCB failed to cross the 200-run mark. The winner goes third on the points table. Who'll come out on top? Promises to be a cracking duel. Join us in a bit for the chase...

Fullish delivery, du Plessis looks to play a premeditated scoop. The line was wide of off and the RCB captain took his eyes off the ball while making contact. Miscues and the ball goes to short fine leg where Vishnu Vinod takes a juggling catch - hold onto it on the third attempt. Big wicket! RCB lose 3 wickets in 3 overs.

Anuj Rawat opens the bat face late, tries to improvise, but ends up playing a completely awkward shot. Miscues this over the cordon as Green ambles back, settles under the skier and completes a safe catch. Behrendorff on fire tonight!

That's a good review from MI!
Kohli's gone. du Plessis was dropped on the previous ball, but Kohli departs on the very next ball. He was down the wicket to have a go at Behrendorff, but he couldn't middle it. Swings across the line, gets a regulation outside edge and Kishan behind the wickets completes the formalities. Was given not out by the umpire, but the review comes to MI's rescue and we won't have a healthy opening stand between the RCB openers tonight!

Behrendorff to du Plessis, 1 run,

Wadhera at mid-wicket has put down an easy chance of du Plessis - the top scorer of the tournament! And Rohit Sharma looks absolutely annoyed with that effort. Was a full loss by Behrendorff and du Plessis flicked it straight to the fielder stationed inside the ring. Wadhera gets his hands to it, but fails to cling on to the catch. How costly will this dropped catch prove to be? du Plessis can hurt you!

Kohli and du Plessis are at the crease. Kohli is on strike. Behrendorff will open the attack
Right then, the players are out in the middle. The two RCB openers - Faf and Virat are ready to roll against a relatively less potent MI bowling attack. Will they continue having a good partnership at the top? Or will we get to see a change in the trend today? Let's find out. Time for the first ball of the match. Here we go!
Here are the Impact substitutes for both the teams:
Mumbai Indians Subs:
Ramandeep Singh, Tristan Stubbs, Vishnu Vinod, Sandeep Warrier, Raghav Goyal
Royal Challengers Bangalore Subs:
Kedar Jadhav, Michael Bracewell, Suyash Prabhudessai, Karn Sharma, Shahbaz Ahmed
Glenn Maxwell:
Has been a great time here. Have enjoyed the last three seasons  here at RCB. It is close at the top. Being part of the group is fun. The rehab process is still going on. It will go on for two more months. It still hurts. Still a long way to go. Just taking the game on. We have been quite consistent as a batting group. Great to see Mahipal get the runs in the last game as well. Our lines and lengths were a little wide. Would be looking to bowl a little tight and straighter.

Faf du Plessis:
Generally you chase here because of the nature of this ground. Big score always creates the scoreboard pressure. They have a good batting line-up, hopefully we get wickets in their innings. There are a lot of teams in the race for that third and fourth spot, we need to play good cricket. One change for us, Vyshak comes in for Karn Sharma.
Rohit Sharma:
We are going to bowl first. It's been good for us, we have chased down targets here, it's a good pitch. Looks like a typical Mumbai pitch with even grass covering and also a few patches. Not sure how it's going to play, but we are hoping for the best. We understand the importance of this game, but what's in our control is in our control. We need to play good cricket, rest will take care of itself. Archer is out, we got Jordan, he will make his debut today.
Mumbai Indians have won the toss and have opted to field
Right then, it's toss time..
Stubbs:
Enjoying this year quite a bit, experiencing more of India. It's been great working with him (Pollard), just sitting next to him during the game, talking to him about the game and how he thinks, just what I've been trying to feed of. You just got to go in and express yourself, whatever the situation is, it's not an easy job, but you just got to try and contribute wherever you can. I think it's going to be a great game against RCB, hopefully we can play our best game. We haven't had a perfect game yet, hopefully we can have that, with bat and ball.
Chris Jordan replaces injured Jofra Archer at Mumbai Indians
As Archer's recovery and fitness continues to be monitored by ECB, the pacer will return home to focus on his rehabilitation, MI said in a statement
Pitch Report | Aaron Finch:
"I think this (surface) will be an absolute beauty. There's a nice even covering of grass right through, on a red soil wicket, that keeps enough pace in it so it doesn't spin too much. I think it'll spin in the first half, there's just a touch of moisture on top. So it'll get better and better as the game goes on."
What RCB can do better? They need to look beyond Virat and Faf a little. Mahipal did come to the party but he has to be more consistent. The bowling has been hapless at times. That can be much better.  What MI can do better? Their bowling has been very inconsistent. Wankhede and their lackadaisical bowling efforts have ensured they have had to chase down big scores.
What has worked for RCB? Faf and Kohli at the top. Siraj with the new ball. RCB have had middle-order woes. But Maxwell has come to the aid at times. What has worked for MI? Surya's return to form has been a major boost. Tilak Verma and Tim David's late order hitting prowess has threatened oppositions. Piyush Chawla's proficiency as a spinner has allowed MI to control a few of the middle overs.
18:20 local time:
Mumbai Indians take on RCB. The two stalwarts of IPL have had contrasting fortunes over the last 15 years. MI have had 5 titles to their credit. RCB have made it to three finals. However, this rivalry hasn't been talked about much. There are no hush hush voices when these two teams meet. That has to evolve. And transform into something fierce. Because these are two teams who enjoy massive fan following. Today might be the day. Because both teams are hungry for those two points. You don't want to look at the points table. It is clogged! It is congested. The winner will spring to number 3 in the table. The loser most possibly go to 8th. That's how much is at stake!

Vijay Tagore
Mumbai Indians vs Royal Challengers Bangalore has been one of the most anticipated games of the IPL 2023 at the Wankhede and no surprise there that it will be a full house on Tuesday night. In popularity charts the marquee contest would go down as the second-most high-profile match-up of the season in the city, the first, of course, is the one against Chennai Super Kings, which has already been played.
With both teams on even keel on the points table, the star-studded match gains extra significance and no doubt it could rise to the levels of intensity that is expected at the business-end of the competition. Both would be trying to wriggle out of the mid-table muddle.
On the eve of the game, there are some troubling questions for hosts Mumbai Indians with avoidable scrutiny on Rohit Sharma. The captain's continued poor run in the season was the immediate point of debate, leaving ephemerally aside the more important assignments - the World Test Championship and the World Cup - in the longer run.
Just 184 runs in 10 games and the 40th position among top scorers' list of the IPL 2023 are not worthy of the batter that he has been. More prominently, he has just two half centuries in 33 IPL games. Further dissection points to only two scores of over 50 runs in the last three IPL seasons.
The perception is that the extended poor form of the skipper may be affecting his leadership and not too long ago, an expert no less than Sunil Gavaskar called for him to take a break. Rohit has not exactly followed that advice but he changed his batting order from the top of the line-up and pushed himself down to No 3 in the previous game. But with very little success.
A skipper in a happy space puts the team too in a happy space and Rohit's form may be reflecting on the points table for MI - 10 points from 10 games and the sixth place. That is a precarious position for a team that has won the IPL five times. But the team said it is fully behind the off-colour skipper.
"Absolutely not (worried about his form). A legend that Rohit is, especially with Mumbai and everything that he has done in his career, we actually back him. He could come back into the form any time. So far, he has batted beautifully in a few games, showing really good tempo at the top, so we are absolutely backing him.," Cameron Green, who opened in place Rohit in the previous game said of the beleaguered skipper who would know that he needs to fire for the franchise on Tuesday night to win the vital game and move up in the points table.
Like MI, Royal Challengers Bangalore too are coming to the contest on the back of a defeat but they may, nevertheless, be having a slight edge over the home team. With key batsmen - Virat Kohli and Faf du Plessis - among runs and Mahipal Lomror also joining the party, RCB could be in a happy space. They would be expecting more meaty contributions from Dinesh Karthik as well as Maxwell.
Their bowling has got the added firepower in the form of Josh Hazlewood, who combines well with Mohammed Siraj and Wanindu Hasaranga, who have done well for the franchise so far. But with the Impact Player rule, this has largely been a batsmen's season and the bowlers, more often than not, have been sent to cleaners. The script is unlikely to be different on Tuesday night.
Kedar Jadhav felt the same. "The impact player rule has made the teams and players braver and fearless. They have an extra batter as a cushion, so obviously they are expressing more and instead of 180 there are more totals above 200," the latest entrant to RCB said on the eve of the game.
When:
Tuesday, May 9, 2023 at 19:30 IST
Where:
Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai
What to expect:
The bounce on offer tends to work in favour of the stroke-makers while the likes of Josh Hazlewood might too find something to their liking. The ground has seen many a high-scoring game already in the season, and the batters are likely to relish the prospect of the conditions as well as the ground-size.
Teams:
Mumbai Indians
Tactics and match-ups:
Jofra Archer was taken down by RCB's openers the last time these two faced off in the season, but it remains a match-up particularly against Faf du Plessis who he has dismissed twice in 22 balls. The other match-up would be that between Piyush Chawla and Glenn Maxwell. The latter has only single-digit scores in away games so far but the conditions at Wankhede could suit his style of play. Against Chawla, there could be fireworks one way or another. He has been dismissed three times in 36 balls but has a strike-rate of 150 against the spinner.
Team news:
Tilak Varma, one of the main contributors with the bat for Mumbai this season, is expected to feature in the XI after having missed the last game vs CSK. The big point, however, is whether Rohit open the batting or will he play at No 3, like in the last game.
Probable XI:
Ishan Kishan, Cameron Green, Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav, Tilak Varma, Tim David, Nehal Wadhera, Jofra Archer, Piyush Chawla, Kumar Kartikeya, Arshad Khan
Royal Challengers Bangalore
Tactics and match-ups:
Fad and Kohli have nine fifties between them at Wankhede and come into this game on the back of some imperious form. They could be targeted early by MI with spin, from Chawla. With the ball RCB might be looking at the Harshal vs Rohit match-up, with the bowler having gotten him thrice in 22 balls. They'd also be hoping for Hasaranga to join the party at the venue where he's picked up a five-fer previously.
Team news:
Karn Sharma may make way for a batsman in the RCB line-up or come in as an Impact Player. Kedar Jadhav, the late entrant to the Bengaluru squad, should retain his place in the side.
Probable XI:
Faf du Plessis, Virat Kohli, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Maxwell, Suyash Prabhudesai/Anuj Rawat, Kedar Jadhav, Dinesh Karthik, Wanindu Hasaranga, Harshal Patel, Josh Hazlewood, Mohammad Siraj

What they said
Our discussions have been to play the same way, be aggressive in the powerplay. The message from the coaching staff is to show the same intent. We've got some incredibly experienced guys, especially around me at the top. We've got Ishan and Rohit, who play for India. We've got SKY after me, so there are a lot of good cricket brains going around. I have had an incredible experience. Mumbai has treated me beautifully. Hopefully I can replay the faith - Cameron Green, MI all-rounder
That is the tagline of RCB is to play bold. I think it came from only Virat Kohli. He has a strong personality, likes to lead from the front. Whatever it is, batting or bowling, he wants to contribute in winning games whichever teams he plays for. It definitely rubs off on the team. The players want to perform close to that level, or close to that intensity he brings in, in his batting or when he is practising - Kedar Jadhav, RCB batsman
