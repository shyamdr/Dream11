So that's that from the first game on double-header Saturday. LSG have just lost KL Rahul in their game against DC. Hop tabs to catch up on all the action. For now it's time to escape. See you soon and take care. Bye.
Shikhar Dhawan, PBKS captain:
It's a great feeling to start the tournament with a win, we'll try to take the momentum in the next game and carry that confidence ahead. According to the situation I used those bowlers, good thing we have got plenty of bowlers in the side. I knew Raza was going to be handy against the left-handers, so he gave us three quality overs. Also have experienced bowlers like Sam Curran and Arshdeep in the side. Wanted to be aggressive and at the same time smart. Was trying to hold one end, and if I got out, someone else would do that. They are youngsters and they are learning. We all are living our dream and we should be happy about it. As a leader I make sure the team stays relaxed and in a happy state of mind.
Arshdeep Singh, Player of the Match:
I tried to be unpredictable. The wicket was good for batting so I was mixing it up. (On giving a stare to Anukul Roy after getting his wicket) He was my batch mate in under-19 cricket. He started to hit me straightaway so I wanted to show aggression. He was also showing aggression so my aggression also came out a bit. Players are expecting that I will bowl yorkers so I tried to surprise them a bit by bowling bouncers. There was some rain around so the wicket had become skiddy, so I was using making use of the conditions on offer. I am enjoying myself and the atmosphere in the dressing room is very good. Going ahead, we will try to keep enjoying and keep winning games for our side. (On Shikhar Dhawan) He has created a very good atmosphere amongst us and we are loving it.
Nitish Rana, KKR captain:
Was thinking of using Anukul with the ball but didn't find the right situation for it. Russell not bowling at the death wasn't because of any injury issue. I just felt like going with my five main bowlers. They batted well, judged the wicket better than us. Anything could've happened if the rain didn't arrive. Venkatesh got out unfortunately as we were trying to get ahead on DLS. The shot was on. Overall it was a good game. Plenty of learnings from it. It's only the first game of the season.
That's it the game has been decided by rain and
PBKS begin the season a winning note
. They win on DLS method. Coming to KKR's chase, it was derailed early on by Arshdeep as Kolkata lost three quick wickets. There was a resurrecting job done by Venkatesh Iyer, who was drafted in as an Impact player and Nitish Rana but the latter fell to Raza and Rinku Singh fell early. At that stage, DreRuss joined Iyer and the duo took the attack to PBKS. But after an expensive over, Sam Curran got the big wicket of Russell and when the rain started appearing, KKR were behind on DLS. Russell's wicket further set them back and despite a couple of sixes, they were behind by 7 on DLS par when play was stopped. Shikhar Dhawan cleverly rotated his spinners to rush through the overs perhaps sensing rain was in the air and the ploy worked. Stick around for the presentations..
19:48 Local Time, 14:18 GMT, 19:48 IST:
Aayush Puthran
our roving eye from the stadium sounds the death-knell on the game with this update:
Match called off at 7.45.
PBKS won by 7 runs (DLS).
Vinay
: I live like 15 kms away from Mohali and here it has been raining since more than 1 hour, I think that's the game.
19:26 Local Time, 13:56 GMT, 19:26 IST:
Live visuals show the covers firmly in place. Still drizzling and we are running out of time.
Aayush from the stadium pings:
If match starts by 7:54 PM, there will be no over reduction. If it restarts after that, one over will get deducted for every four minutes of delay.

Sam Curran to Thakur,
SIX
, what a shot!
From Lord Thakur himself
. A short of length delivery on the stumps, seam-up and he has just casually whipped that from there over deep mid-wicket, pristine timing and it sails away
Shardul Thakur, right handed bat, comes to the crease
14.5
Sam Curran to Russell,
out
Caught by Raza!! Is that the game? The short ball dug in off-pace on the stumps, Russell does not get hold of the pull and holes out to deep mid-wicket. Raza takes it and Russell is aghast as he curses himself and walks off. Now the odds are against KKR. Sam Curran comes back well to get the massive wicket.

Caught!!
14.4
Sam Curran to Russell,
FOUR
, cheeky and effective. Russell was cramped by this short ball on the stumps, as he leant back, he just guides with an open face, using the bat like a ramp, over backward point and short third man
Arshdeep Singh runs up to Sam Curran to have a word
14.3
Sam Curran to Russell,
SIX
, slammed over wide long-on. It's a low full-toss on the stumps, Russell clouts that over mid-wicket, such a clean strike

That 18-run Nathan Ellis over has sparked life into this contest again. Poor from the Aussie to bowl two front foot no-balls. Still a tall ask for KKR from here but when Russell is there, there is hope.

out
Caught by Raza!! A big stare from Arshdeep Singh at Anukul Roy after getting the batter out. Dug in short outside off, Anukul fetched the pull but did not time it, finds mid-wicket who is on the edge of the ring. Arshdeep celebrates by staring down Anukul. Two in the over and he has given his side a dream start.

17:50 Local Time, 12:20 GMT, 17:50 IST:
Looks like the issue is sorted. PBKS run on to the field and we should have action soon. That's great news. A delay of around 25-26 minutes but we don't lose any overs remember.
The lights are starting to flicker on. The PBKS team split into groups and have a chat. Shikhar has called his team in till the lights come on. Should take some time still. Live visuals show 6 towers lighted up. The others are not.
Welcome back. The players are walking out to the middle. A slip in for Curran.
PBKS have made their impact sub - Rajapaksa out and Rishi Dhawan in.
We are still waiting for something. Don't know why. Get on with it! Apparently the floodlights are yet to light up. So we wait.
Bhanuka Rajapaksa:
I don’t think it is a typical Mohali wicket. It helped the spinners and pacers in the later part of the innings. It actually wasn’t the easiest to get set in the beginning. (On taking the attack to Narine) I think it is actually the instincts that took over when mid-off came up. I spoke to Shikhar and told him that I am going to go down the track. Surely, it is a good total on the board, we were thinking about 180-185. Hopefully, our bowlers will do well and can get us across the line. (On Trevor Bayliss’ message to him) So clear. He wants me to bat top of the order and bat with a clear mind.

PBKS finish with 191 on a pitch which looks quite good for batting. Prabhsimran, Dhawan, and Rajapaksa got them off to a flier against the new ball which hardly did anything for the seamers. Didn't turn much later either. However, excellent spells from Umesh and Chakravarthy helped KKR pull things back. PBKS were 100/1 after 10 overs, and were looking good to go over 200. It's still a strong total, but definitely not out of reach here on this belter of a pitch and fast outfield. We'll be back shortly for the chase.

19.6
Southee to Sam Curran, no run, slower one on the shorter side, Curran advances down and is deceived by the length being pulled back. He's through the pull early, and misses completely. A dot to finish the innings!
19.5
Southee to Sam Curran, 2 runs, full at the stumps, in the slot for Curran who clears the front leg to slog. But he drags it off a thick inside edge through midwicket
19.4
Southee to Sam Curran, 2 runs, slower length ball on leg, Curran hangs back and clips it gently through midwicket. Probably didn't get the room to free the arms and had to adjust
19.3
Southee to Sam Curran,
SIX
, now he goes at the stumps to Curran, instead of going wide, and gets whacked for six! Slower one floated up on middle, Curran clears the front leg and nails it over long-on
19.2
Southee to Shahrukh Khan, 1 run, Southee sticks to the plan, bowls another slower one wide of off, and Shahrukh miscues it off the toe-end to long-off. Instead of going through extra cover like the previous delivery, he tried clubbing this one down the ground

Varun
: PBKS has some serious hitting ability in their finishers this season with the likes of Curran, Livingstone, Sikander Raza, SRK and Jitesh Sharma. Even Brar can hit ball a long way and they also have an option of Raj Bawa as an impact player going forward.

12.5
Umesh Yadav to Jitesh Sharma,
FOUR
, again Jitesh steps across the stumps. Wants to exploit the field with fine leg and square leg both in the ring. And Umesh plays into his hands this time as he dishes out a slower bouncer. It sits up nicely and Jitesh pulls it over short fine
THK Hari
: Consequences of Impact player rule so far are more freedom to batsmen, more focus on specialist roles, good in case of injury concerns, good for older players.

10.4
Umesh Yadav to Rajapaksa, 2 runs, full outside off, Rajapaksa goes much harder at it this time, and
slices it in the air off the outside half!
It falls safely though after clearing extra cover. He gets back for two and
brings up fifty off just 30 balls
10.3
Umesh Yadav to Rajapaksa, 2 runs, not much of a flourish from Rajapaksa as he
punches this in the air!
Mid-off is in the ring and his idea is to just chip it over him, which he does comfortably. Southee gives a good chase though to flick it inside the ropes

Umesh Yadav to Dhawan, 1 run, steps across the stumps, Umesh keeps it full and wide, and gets driven to deep extra cover
10.1
Umesh Yadav to Dhawan,

STAT: This is the highest score for Rajapaksa in 23 innings in all T20s since the Asia Cup final last year. He has struggled in the last year, which is why he was omitted @Mohammed Bilal
The umpire had called it an over but he has been reminded by the third umpire that Thakur had bowled one ball short in the previous over. He had gone to his fielding position at the boundary and has to run all the way back in to bowl the final ball of the over.

Sunil Narine [1.0-0-14-0] is back into the attack
Narine will continue his spell. He was taken away for 14 runs in his first over but he has got good protection in the deep now.
Ashok
: "What was that on 4.5? If it was on thigh it should be leg bye right? If shot was not offered or played will it be no run? New rule?" -- Not new, that has always been the case
Time-out!
Prabhsimran set the tone for Punjab as he played a breezy cameo at the top. Dhawan has looked solid as well and Bhanuka has came in and has played amazingly well. The latter has manufactured shots at will and has kept the pressure on KKR. The visitors need to find a way to break this stand or it can get very tough for them.
Tanoj Nahan
: "4.5 over - Why leg bye not given" -- No shot offered, so no runs awarded

Time for spin. Sunil Narine comes in for a bowl.
Priyanshu Poddar
: People touting Umesh to be replaced as the Impact Sub but of late he's been tonking a few with the bat too. He can certainly hit a long ball & KKR's best bet in my opinion would be to replace Chakravarthy for an extra batter when they come out to bat.

Soft dismissal!
Prabhsimran will be disappointed with himself but he has provided a flying start to his side. Good length ball swinging in on leg, he moves inside the line and tries to work it across, perhaps towards fine leg but he only manages a nick behind. Gurbaz moves to his left and takes a regulation catch.

Shikhar Dhawan and Prabhsimran Singh will be eyeing to provide Punjab Kings a good start. Umesh Yadav to start off the proceedings with the ball. A wide slip in place. Here we go..
So it's bright and sunny here in Mohali,
confirms Aayush from the stadium.
Persistent light drizzle over the last couple of days threatened a possibility of a rain-abandoned opener. Thankfully, the sky has been clear today even if slightly gloomy in the morning.
Andre Russell:
To be honest, even though it might look small, you still have to get good bat to ball. I still respect every ground that I play in. It's just hitting the ball in the stands as usual. Always been fun playing in India. The environment, and the love from the fans, home and away, is just unbelievable. It is something to cherish and I will do my best in whatever role. (On being a senior player along with Narine) Whenever you think too much, you might get a bit of pressure. So, I try to be as relaxed as possible. In the back of my mind, I know that we've been here for years now and he is more senior than me. I look to make sure to get the job done and do my best all the time. (On their roles) Yeah, we do talk about it but not that much. I know that my part is to finish games, to get the team to a good total whenever batting first. He knows his job is to bowl four overs, get as many wickets as possible and keep bowling tight. My job in the field is to field in the hotspots. So, at the end of the day, we discuss stuff but not too much. He knows his role, I know my role. (On their targets) I won't say it, but I do have my goals when I come to tournaments. I'd like to raise the bar every year. Sometimes it doesn't happen, but I still set the standards and the bar high. So, whenever you achieve it, you contribute to the team too.

Teams:
Punjab Kings
(Playing XI): Shikhar Dhawan(c), Prabhsimran Singh, Bhanuka Rajapaksa, Jitesh Sharma(w), Shahrukh Khan, Sam Curran, Sikandar Raza, Nathan Ellis, Harpreet Brar, Rahul Chahar, Arshdeep Singh
Kolkata Knight Riders
(Playing XI): Rahmanullah Gurbaz(w), Mandeep Singh, Nitish Rana(c), Rinku Singh, Andre Russell, Shardul Thakur, Sunil Narine, Tim Southee, Anukul Roy, Umesh Yadav, Varun Chakaravarthy
Shikhar Dhawan | Punjab Kings captain:
We would have fielded first. Getting the impact player in the second innings can create more of an impact. Happy to bat as well. We have got a balanced side, so hopefully we will do good. The team preparation has been good and we will look to dominate the game, hoping for a great season ahead. We are eager to win the trophy and I am looking to lead from the front. My overseas players are - Bhanuka, Nathan Ellis, and Sam Curran, don't remember the fourth name.
Nitish Rana | Kolkata Knight Riders Captain:
We will bowl first, it has rained in the last two days so there would be some moisture. I am excited because very few people get this opportunity. It is a game of cricket afterall so there is not much pressure. The impact player rule is in its initial stage. We have to see that the decisions we take prove to be right. Russell, Narine, Gurbaz and Southee are our overseas players.
Kolkata Knight Riders have won the toss and have opted to field
Rahul Chahar:
My preparation has been good. I got injured during red-ball season, so I was preparing for white-ball season. We have a new coach and we have a new plan, so let’s hope for the best. (On Sunil Joshi, Punjab Kings spin bowling coach) I have learnt a lot from him. Being a leg-spinner, he advises me to go for wickets. As this is a big ground, it will be very helpful for spinners, especially with the square boundaries big.
Mustafa Moudi
: KKR can benefit the most with this Impact Player rule as they have Umesh Yadav who is Powerplay Specialist. They can bowl him out in the first 7 overs and replace him after that !!
Pitch report:
"Average first innings score in afternoon matches here is 159, nine runs less than evening matches. Also, 80 percent matches have been won by teams chasing. A lot of that has to do with the moisture in the surface. However, this pitch is light brown in colour which tells me there's not a lot of moisture. It's also very hard, so it might be more even for teams batting first and chasing. There's a good covering of grass, looks quite even. Dimensions of the ground are unique. If you go to the eastern side, it's the larger of the two boundaries - 72 meters in distance, and also against the wind. That's not where you want to hit. Down the ground is 77 meters. Spinners would want to capitalise on that." -
Daren Ganga
Kolkata Knight Riders will be led by Nitish Rana. It was a forced change as Shreyas Iyer got injured during the BGT. It will be a real test for him but he has some exciting players at his disposal. They are a side who rely on all-rounders and they certainly bat deep. Shardul Thakur and Lockie Ferguson were traded in by them pre-season and that definitely adds sharpness to their bowling. In the last season, both Punjab and Kolkata had middling returns and they will be eager to come to the fore with a solid opening game. Will Punjab Kings rule the roost at their home ground? Or will KKR fire on all cylinders today? The toss and team lineups will be out in a while.
14:31 Local Time, 09:01 GMT, 14:31 IST:
It’s a new dawn for both Punjab Kings and KKR with new captains and new coaches at the helm. New beginnings always provide opportunities to shine and emerge as heroes. Both teams are facing some injury concerns and player availability issue for their opening game. Punjab begin their quest for the IPL trophy under Shikhar Dhawan. Although they haven’t won the IPL till now, they do have a lot of firepower in their side. They bought Sam Curran with a record-breaking bid at the auction and the young man will be certainly striving to impress. Death bowling was an issue for them in the previous edition but Sam Curran can be the ace for them in partnership with Arshdeep Singh.
14:15 Local Time, 8:45 GMT, 14:15 IST:
Cricket is definitely a religion in India -  we witnessed a prime example of the same at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad yesterday as the 16th season of IPL kicked off. The entire stadium was jam-packed with passionate fans rooting for their respective team, with seas of yellows and blues coming to prominence. A grand opening ceremony was followed by a closely fought encounter between GT and CSK, with the home side, the defending champions, sailing to the finish line in style! The IPL caravan now moves on to the northern part of India where Punjab Kings will be hosting Kolkata Knight Riders in Mohali.
